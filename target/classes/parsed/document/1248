1248  an analytic extension of the shockexpansion method   waldman,gd and probstein,rf  j ae scs 1961, 119  an analytic extension of the shockexpansion method    the problem is considered of calculating approximately the inviscid rotational flow field and pressure distribution about a smooth twodimensional airfoil with sharp leading and trailing edges in a uniform supersonic or hypersonic stream   the assumption of a perfect gas is made, and the basic flow pattern for the analysis is taken to be given by the simple isentropic shockexpansion method with straight characteristics   an elementary characteristics treatment is discussed to show when the simple shockexpansion method should be satisfactory for computing the surface pressure distribution, and under what circumstances it may be expected to break down   by utilizing characteristic variables the isentropic shockexpansion method is then formulated analytically, and an analytic result is obtained for the shock shape corresponding to this zeroorder approximation   in the special case where hypersonic similitude is applicable, that is, for slender bodies and high mach numbers, the shockshape expression for large distances is found to reduce to the result previously given by mahony, which for weak shocks and slender bodies in turn reduces to the simplewave result first given by friedrichs    employing the analytic form of the isentropic shockexpansion method as a zeroorder approximation, an analytically consistent perturbation method is developed by expanding the dependent flow variables in the exact partial differential equations in powers of the reflection coefficient for simple waves interacting with an oblique shock   the scheme by its nature helps to define those regions in which shock expansion can be used, in addition to taking into account in a perturbation sense the factors neglected in simple shockexpansion theory, namely, the curvature and reflection of the mach waves and the correct boundary conditions at the shock wave   analytic solutions are obtained for the firstorder corrections, including the surface pressure distribution   the necessary numerical computation of the integrals involved is considerably simpler than a direct application of the method of characteristics   to illustrate the method and its accuracy, the zeroorder shock shape and firstorder pressure distribution are calculated for a family of parabolic arc airfoils at an infinite freestream mach number   these results are compared with rotational characteristic solutions where available, and the present method is found to be in excellent agreement
