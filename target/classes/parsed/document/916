916  the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonic speeds   landahl, mt  kth aero tn40, 1954   the flow around oscillating low aspect ratio wings at transonic speeds  when certain conditions are fulfilled for thickness ratio, aspect ratio,  and reduced frequency for a threedimensional wing, it can be shown that the partial differential equation for the nonsteady perturbation potential can be reduced to a comparatively simple linear equation  the solution is then obtained by applying a fourier transformation in the freestream direction and then using an iterative process developed by adams and sears for steady flow  the method gives solutions valid for low combinations of aspect ratio and reduced frequency  the method is applied to a delta wing oscillating in some selected rigid  and elastic modes  from the results it can be seen that the special nonsteady forces in the potential equation, which are neglected in slenderbody theory, are very important  stability derivatives can also  be obtained by the method and it is seen that the damping in pitch may be negative at m 1 for delta wings of too high aspect ratio
