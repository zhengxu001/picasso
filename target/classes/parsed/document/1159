1159  experimental investigation of the effect of yaw on rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders in a 6500footpersecond hypersonic air stream   bernard e cunningham and samuel kraus   experimental investigation of the effect of yaw on rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders in a 6500footpersecond hypersonic air stream  a technique has been developed by which air can be shockcompressed by helium to 3660 degrees rankine to generate a 6500footpersecond air stream with a flow duration of 40 milliseconds   the resulting equipment is described   experiments were conducted to determine rates of heat transfer to transverse circular cylinders of 0003, greater than 100   the cylinders were tested at a nominal mach number of 11 with a stagnation reynolds number (evaluated with freestream mass flow and stagnation viscosity of 400 times 10 to the 4th power per foot
