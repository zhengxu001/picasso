696  pressure loads produced on a flatplate wing by rocket jets exhausting in a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to a freestream flow of mach number 20   falangan, ra and janos, j j  nasa tn d893, 1961   pressure loads produced on a flatplate wing by rocket jets exhausting in a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to a freestream flow of mach number 20  an investigation at a reynolds number per foot of 144 x 10 was made to determine the pressure loads produced on a flatplate wing by rocket jets exhausting in a spanwise direction beneath the wing and perpendicular to a freestream flow of mach number 20  the ranges of the variables involved were /1/ nozzle types  one sonic /jet mach number of twodimensional supersonic /jet mach number of 171/, /2/ vertical nozzle positions beneath the wing of 4, 8, and 12 nozzlethroat diameters, and /3/ ratios of rocketchamber total pressure to freestream static pressure from 0 to 130  the incremental normal force due to jet interference on the wing varied from one to two times the rocket thrust and generally decreased as the pressure ratio increased  the chordwise coordinate of the incrementalnormalforce center of pressure remained upstream of the nozzle center line for the nozzle positions and pressure ratios of the investigation   the chordwise coordinate approached zero as the jet vertical distance beneath the wing increased  in the spanwise direction there was little change due to varying rocketjet position and pressure ratio  some boundarylayer flow separation on the wing was observed for the rocket jets close to the wing and at the higher pressure ratios  the magnitude  of the chordwise and spanwise pressure distributions due to jet interference was greatest for rocket jets close to the wing and decreased as the jet was displaced farther from the wing  the design procedure for the rockets used is given in the appendix
