487  theory for supersonic twodimensional, laminar, basetype flows using the croccolees mixing concepts   rom,j  jaescs 29, 1962, 963  theory for supersonic twodimensional, laminar, basetype flows using the croccolees mixing concepts    a separated flow field, in which the incoming boundary layer is undisturbed up to the separation point, is defined as a / basetype/ flow   examples are the flows over a blunt base and over a backwardfacing step   the croccolees theory is applied to the supersonic, twodimensional, laminar, basetype flows defined above   the separated flow is divided into a mixing region and a recompression (or reattachment) region   calculations of base pressure show its dependence on the mach number and on two reynoldsnumberdependent variables, and    it is shown that existing basepressure data can be explained by these results
