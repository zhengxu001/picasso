712  lowspeed longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of lowaspect ratio wings having variations in leadingedge contour   spencer, b and hammond, ad  nasa tn d1374, 1962   lowspeed longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of lowaspect ratio wings having variations in leadingedge contour  an investigation has been conducted at various reynolds numbers and low subsonic speeds to determine the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of lowaspectratio wings having variations in leadingedge contours  the planforms included a highly swept triangular wing, a rectangular wing, and intermediate wings including planforms having elliptic and parabolic leadingedge contours, all having an aspect ratio of 133  the effects of changing aspect ratio for a  given leadingedge contour were investigated for two of the wings presented, also included are the longitudinal characteristics associated with various fuselage sizes  an effort has been made to estimate the lift variation with angle of attack for the wing planforms of the present investigation  improvements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible by slight alterations in leadingedge design, which should still conform  to possible design requirements at hypersonic speeds  these changes in  planform resulted in increases in liftcurve slope, lift at high angles  of attack, and in the maximum untrimmed liftdrag ratio, provided the fuselage was sufficiently small  the longitudinal stability characteristics of the majority of planforms indicate more desirable stability characteristics at high lifts than either a triangular wing or rectangular wing of the same aspect ratio  the effects of increasing reynolds number for each of the planforms investigated generally resulted in slight reductions in the lift at high angles of attack  a method is presented for estimating the subsoniclift variation with angle of attack for the lowaspectratio wings of the present investigation and indicated good agreement with experimental data throughout the angleofattack range of this investigation
