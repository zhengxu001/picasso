1353  investigation of a twostep nozzle in the langley 11in    hypersonic tunnel   mclellan,ch naca tn2171, 1950  investigation of a twostep nozzle in the langley 11in   hypersonic tunnel    flow surveys have been made in the first of several nozzles to be investigated in the langley 11inch hypersonic tunnel   the nozzle was designed by the method of characteristics for a mach number of 698   two step expanded the air in the horizontal plane to a mach number of 436 and the second in the vertical plane to a mach number of 698    the test results showed that, although a maximum mach number of about 65 was obtained, the flow in the test section was not sufficiently uniform for quantitative windtunnel test purposes   deviations from the design flow were traced to the presence of a thick boundary layer which developed in the first step along the parallel walls
