761  buckling of sandwich under normal pressure   yao,jc  j ae scs 29, 1962, 264  buckling of sandwich under normal pressure    a theoretical study is made of the buckling of a sandwich sphere comprised of a core layer of lowmodulus material and two thin facing layers of higher modulus material   the solution for the buckling resistance of the sphere under normal external pressure is obtained by linearized theory, and is reducible to the classical solution for monocoque spherical shells   critical buckling pressures are calculated for various radiusthickness ratios and sphere materials
