401  inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled nonequilibrium processes   hall,jg, eschenroeder,aw and marrone,pv  ias paper 6267, 1962  inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled nonequilibrium processes    analyses have been made of the effects of coupled chemical rate processes in external inviscid hypersonic airflows at high enthalpy levels   exact (numerical) solutions have been obtained by the inverse method for inviscid airflow over a nearspherical nose under flight conditions where substantial nonequilibrium prevails through the nose region   typical conditions considered include nose radii of the order of 1 ft at an altitude of 250,000 ft and velocities of 15,000 and 23,000 ft per sec    the results illustrate the general importance of the coupling among the reactions considered   these included dissociationrecombination, bimolecularexchange, and ionization reactions  the exact solutions show the bimolecular, no exchange reactions to be important in bluntnose flow for the kinetics of no and n, as they are in the case of a plane shock wave   an important difference between bluntnose flow and plane shock flow, however, is the gasdynamic expansion in the curved shock layer of the former   this expansion reduces postshock reaction rates   as a consequence, in the regime studied the oxygen and nitrogenatom concentrations tend to freeze in the nose region at levels below those for infiniterate equilibrium   the reduction below the equilibrium dissociation level can be large, particularly for nitrogen dissociation at higher velocities    in the regime considered, the chemical kinetics are dominated by twobody collision processes   the inviscid nose flow, including coupled nonequilibrium phenomena, is thus amenable to binary scaling for a given velocity   the binary scaling is demonstrated for a range of altitude and scale by correlation of the exact solutions for given velocity and a constant product of ambient density and nose radius   this similitude, which can also scale viscous nonequilibrium and radiation phenomena in the shock layer, provides a useful flexibility for hypersonic testing where it is applicable    the afterbody inviscidflow problem is briefly discussed in the light of the results for the nose flow
