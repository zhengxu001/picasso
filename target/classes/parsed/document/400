400  buckling stress of clamped rectangular plates in shear   budiansky,b and connor,rw  naca tn1559, 1948  buckling stress of clamped rectangular plates in shear    by consideration of antisymmetrical, as well as symmetrical, buckling configurations, the theoretical shear buckling stresses of clamped rectangular flat plates are evaluated more correctly than in previous work   the results given, which represent the average of upper and lowerlimit solutions obtained by the lagrangian multiplier method, are within percent of the true buckling stresses
