748  subsonic aerodynamic flutter derivatives for wings and control surfaces,  /compressible and incompressible flow/   minhinnick, i t  rae rep structs 87 july 1950   subsonic aerodynamic flutter derivatives for wings and control surfaces,  /compressible and incompressible flow/  this report gives tables of the twodimensional subsonic flutter derivatives, where possible the values given are based on the published  work of various authors, but some have been specially calculated for this report  wing derivatives are given for mach numbers 0, 05, 06 and 07 for the frequency parameter range 0 /004/ 02 /02/ 16 and mach numbers 0 and 07 for frequency parameter 50  control surface derivatives are given for mach numbers 0 and 07 for control surface/ wing chord ratios 002 /002/ 010 /005/ 050 and frequency parameters are also given for mach numbers 0, 05, 06 and 07 for frequency parameter 0 /004/ 02 /02/ 14  control surfacetab derivatives are given for some particular values of the variables and methods of obtaining approximate values of these derivatives for other values of the variables are suggested  control surface and tab derivatives are in  all cases for no aerodynamic balance
