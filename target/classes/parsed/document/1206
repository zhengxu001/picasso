1206  magnetohydrodynamic mach cones   cumberbatch,e  j ae scs 1962, 1476  magnetohydrodynamic mach cones    features of the surfaces of main disturbance created by a small object in steady motion through a conducting fluid are examined  these surfaces are found by drawing tangent cones from the object to the relevant wavefront diagrams   the outer wave cone (when present) is smooth, but the two inner cones have cross sections similar to the cusped figures of the inner wavefront diagram   it is conjectured that the disturbance may be concentrated along such line cusps   this has particular relevance in the application of known twodimensional results to threedimensional problems, say in the wellknown techniques of aerodynamics   in mhd the omission of the large disturbance characteristics implicit in a twodimensional solution may invalidate its use in any practical threedimensional problem
