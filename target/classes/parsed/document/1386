1386  analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminar compressible boundary layer with heat transfer and with and without pressure gradient   morduchow,m  naca r1245, 1955  analysis and calculation by integral methods of laminar compressible boundary layer with heat transfer and with and without pressure gradient    a survey of integral methods in laminarboundarylayer analysis is first given   a simple and sufficiently accurate method for practical purposes of calculating the properties layer in an axial pressure gradient with heat transfer at the wall is then presented   for flow over a flat plate, the method is applicable for an arbitrarily prescribed distribution of temperature along the surface and for any given constant prandtl number close to unity   for flow in a pressure gradient, the method is based on a prandtl number of unity and a uniform wall temperature   a simple and accurate method of determining the separation point in a compressible flow with an adverse pressure gradient over a surface at a given uniform wall temperature is developed   the analysis is based on an extension of the karmanpohlhausen method to the momentum and thermal energy equations in conjunction with fourth and especially higher degree velocity and stagnationenthalpy profiles   from the equations derived here, conclusions regarding the effect of pressure gradient, mach number, and wall temperature on the boundarylayer characteristics are derived and illustrated   in particular the effects on skinfriction, heattransfer coefficient, separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, and stability of the laminar boundary layer are analyzed
