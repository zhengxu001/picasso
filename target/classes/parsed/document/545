545  calculation of sideslip derivatives and pressure distribution in asymmetric flight conditions on a slender wingfin configuration   sells,ccl  rae tnaero2805, 1962  calculation of sideslip derivatives and pressure distribution in asymmetric flight conditions on a slender wingfin configuration    the flow around slender wingfin configurations having curved leading edges, whose shape is defined by polynomials, is considered   a general expression for the pressure distribution on such a configuration in asymmetric flow is derived and the derivatives due to the particular case of sideslipping motion are also given  no numerical results are given for wingfin load distribution, but the sideslip derivatives have been evaluated in a number of cases for gothic and ogee wings
