565  similar solutions for the compressible boundary layer on a yawed cylinder with transpiration cooling   beckwith,ie  naca tn4345, 1958  similar solutions for the compressible boundary layer on a yawed cylinder with transpiration cooling    heattransfer and skinfriction parameters obtained from exact numerical solutions to the laminar compressibleboundarylayer equations for the infinite cylinder in yaw are presented   the chordwise flow in the transformed plane is of the falknerskan type   solutions are given for chordwise stagnation flow with both a porous and a nonporous wall  the effect of a linear viscositytemperature relation is compared with the effect of the sutherland viscositytemperature relation at the stagnation line of the cylinder for a prandtl number of 07   the effects of pressure gradient, mach number, yaw angle, and wall temperature are investigated for a linear viscositytemperature relation and a prandtl number of 10 with a nonporous wall    the results indicate that compressibility effects become important at large mach numbers and yaw angles, with larger percentage effects on the skin friction than on the heat transfer   the use of the two different viscosity relations gives about the same results except when large changes in temperature occur across the boundary layer, as for a highly cooled wall   the present solutions predict that a larger amount of coolant would be required at a given large mach number and yaw angle than would be predicted from solutions of the corresponding incompressibleboundarylayer equations
