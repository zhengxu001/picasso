258  the effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubrication   chou,yt and saibei,e  jappmech 25, 1959, 122  the effect of turbulence on slider bearing lubrication  based on prandtl mixinglength mechanism, the pressure equation for turbulent flow in sliderbearing lubrication is derived   an analytical solution is given and compared with the one for laminar flow   it is found that the turbulent effect increases the pressure and consequently, the loadcarrying capacity   however, the power loss also increases
