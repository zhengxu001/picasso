1270  supersonic inlet dynamics   fraiser,hr  j ae scs 1960, 429  supersonic inlet dynamics    an approximation of the differential equation for compressible duct flow is presented   the equation is linear and of the second order   the duct transfer function and response characteristics are obtained by applying smallperturbation theory to the differential equation   the resulting equations describe duct natural frequency as a function of duct areas and volumes, and damping ratio as a function of the slope of the steadystate mass flow, pressurerecovery curve    the calcualted response agrees, to a first approximation, with measured response as obtained from tests of a fixedgeometry, sugarscoop inlet model with hypass for matching airflows  testing was done in the 10 x 10 and 8 x 6 ft supersonic tunnels at nasa lewis flight propulsion laboratory   further agreement was obtained during flight tests of the f8u3 airplane
