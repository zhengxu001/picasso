334  influence of the leadingedge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer at hypersonic speeds   lester lees  california institute of technology  influence of the leadingedge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer at hypersonic speeds  in order to bring out the importance of the leadingedge region at hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leadingedge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of steady flow over a semiinfinite, insulated flat plate  (1) sharp leading edge, (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal shock wave   the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave very near the leadingedge, where the shock is strong and highly curved   consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the boundary layer is appreciably higher than freestream temperature, and the vorticity there is not zero   the effects of this shockwave larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundarylayer theory, and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the framework of that theory   the numerical magnitude of the shockwave influence is found to be appreciable   for the case of the blunt leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this parameter   these approximate results show that the influence of the leadingedge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical and experimental study
