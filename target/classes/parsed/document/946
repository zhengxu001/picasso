946  exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach number 6 free stream   romeo,dj and sterrett,jr  nasa tnd1605, 1963  exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach number 6 free stream    the effect of a forwardfacing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach 6 free stream was investigated experimentally   the models tested had forwardfacing jets using air and helium exhausting at mach numbers from 1 to 103 and were run through a range of the ratio of jet total pressure to freestream total pressure of 003 (jet off) to 25   the ratio of body diameter to jetexit diameter varied from 112 to 556 and the angle of attack was varied from 0 to 35    the experimental results show that the mainstream shock can be affected by the jet in two significantly different ways  one way is simply to move the strong shock away from the body without altering its shape   the second and perhaps more interesting case occurs when the jet causes a large displacement of the main shock and considerably changes its shape   it was found that the ratio of jet total pressure to freestream total pressure necessary to obtain the large displacements of the mainstream shock depended on the ratio of body diameter to jetexit diameter and also on the jetexit mach number   the maximum amount the shock could be displaced in percent of body diameter was seen to increase with increasing jetexit mach number and also with decreasing ratio of body diameter to jetexit diameter   for the models that were investigated through an angleofattack range, the displacement became very unsteady and fell off sharply as the angle of attack was increased    simplified theoretical considerations applied to the shockdisplacement phenomena provide a possible explanation for the two different types of mainstream shock displacement   theoretical curves show the regions where these types of displacement would occur for different exit mach numbers and pressure ratios for a forwardfacing jet in a mach 6 stream
