542  biot variational principle in heat conduction   lardner,tj  aiaa j 1963, 196  biot variational principle in heat conduction    biot variational principle is applied to a number of different onedimensional heat conduction problems   these problems show the applicability of the variational principle to problems involving prescribed heat flux boundary conditions and to those with temperaturedependent material properties    a method is introduced for including boundary conditions when these are expressed as prescribed heat fluxes   the idea behind this is overall energy balance within the body, which is a constraint condition to be satisfied by the time histories of the generalized coordinates    the variational principle is then applied to the wellknown problem of constant surface heat flux in order to present the technique and provide a basis for the remaining sections   the equivalence of the result obtained in applying the variational principle for a prescribed surface temperature history to that obtained for a prescribed heat flux is also pointed out   radiation cooling due to fourth power radiation from semiinfinite solids and finite slabs together with radiation according to newton law of cooling is then treated   finally, the introduction of temperaturedependent material properties is discussed and the determination of the temperature distribution in a semiinfinite solid with variable properties is investigated
