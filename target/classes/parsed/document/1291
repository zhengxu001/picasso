1291  atmosphere entries with spacecraft liftdrag ratios modulated to limit decelerations   levy,ll  nasa tnd1427, 1962  atmosphere entries with spacecraft liftdrag ratios modulated to limit decelerations    an analysis has been made of atmosphere entries for which the spacecraft liftdrag ratios were modulated to limit the maximum deceleration   the parts of the drag polars used during modulation were from maximum lift coefficient to minimum drag coefficient   five drag polars of different shapes were assumed for the spacecraft   the entries covered wide ranges of initial velocity, initial flightpath angle, initial and maximum liftdrag ratio  twodimensional trajectory calculations were made for a nonrotating, spherical earth with an exponential atmosphere  the results of the analysis indicate for four of the five drag polars that, relative to the maximum deceleration of an unmodulated entry at maximum liftdrag ratio, the greatest reduction in maximum deceleration obtainable by modulation depends upon a single parameter   this parameter is the ratio of the value of the aerodynamic resultantforce coefficient at minimum drag coefficient to the value at maximum lift coefficient   thus, the reduction in maximum deceleration is independent of initial velocity, initial flightpath angle, initial maximum liftdrag ratio, and the shape of the drag polar   for the fifth drag polar, the reduction in maximum deceleration was found to depend upon the maximum liftdrag ratio  also, relative to the depth of a given decelerationlimited corridor, the greatest increase in corridor depth obtainable by modulation (for four of the five drag polars) depends upon the same ratio of aerodynamic resultantforce coefficients   the fractional increase in corridor depth can be expressed as an empirically determined analytical function of this ratio
