1250  highspeed viscous corner flow   bloom,mh and rubin,s  j ae scs 1961, 145  highspeed viscous corner flow    a boundarylayer integral method analysis is set up for compressible laminar flow in a symmetric corner with varying angle and streamwise pressure gradient   it represents an extension and modification of the constant density analysis of loitsianskii and bolshakov   the analysis is applied to the case of constant pressure, constant corner angle, and isothermal surfaces, for which the crocco velocityenthalpy relation holds   although simplifying assumptions limit the quantitative accuracy outside the 60 to 120 angle range, some qualitative trends are probably correct outside this range   the limiting cases near 0 and 180 are not considered    favorable agreement between some results obtained by the integral method and by other methods is demonstrated for the isothermal, constantdensity case    results show an increasingly sharp merger of the outermost isovels of streamwise velocity as the mach number increases  this sharp merging of the outer isovels is increased by increasing corner angle and by insulation of heating of the surfaces   within the interior of the viscous layer the spreading or contraction of the disturbed region of merging is influenced by surface heattransfer conditions   surface shear and heat flux are decreased in the disturbed region, and are zero at the apex   for cases corresponding roughly to the higher mach numbers of wider corner angles, the /specific momentumarea/ exhibits the same decrease with mach number as its twodimensional counterpart, whereas the /specific displacementarea,/ a measure of streamtube dilation, increases more rapidly with mach number than the comparable twodimensional parameter
