1203  the propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave into a moving monatomic fluid   gundersen,rm  j ae scs 1962, 1421  the propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave into a moving monatomic fluid    an initially uniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave of arbitrary strength propagates through a channel which consists of two portions of which one has uniform crosssectional area while the other is of varying crosssectional area   it is assumed that the flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initially a uniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations) of this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encountered  when the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed, the shock strength altered and the subsequent flow is nonisentropic   in addition to the perturbation due to the effect of the area variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there are two further contributionsviz, a permanent perturbation caused directly by the area changes and a transient disturbancewhich propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flow behind the shock, due to reflections of the permanent perturbation at the shock   expressions for these various contributions are obtained   the results presented include as special cases propagation of a nonuniform conventional gas dynamic shock into a moving nonconduction fluid and propagation of a nonuniform hydromagnetic shock wave into a stationary fluid
