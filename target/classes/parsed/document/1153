1153  a study of the simulation of flow with free stream mach number 1 in a choked wind tunnel   spreiter, jr, smith, dw and hyett, bj  nasa tr r73, 1960   a study of the simulation of flow with free stream mach number 1 in a choked wind tunnel  the degree to which experimental results obtained under choking conditions in a wind tunnel with solid walls simulate those associated with an unbounded flow with freestream mach number 1 is investigated for the  cases of twodimensional and axisymmetric flows  it is found that a close resemblance does indeed exist in the vicinity of the body, and that the results obtained in this way are generally at least as accurate  as those obtained in a transonic wind tunnel with partly open test section  some of the results indicate, however, that substantial interference effects, particularly those of the wave reflection type, may be encountered under certain conditions, both in choked wind tunnels and  in transonic wind tunnels, and that the reduction of these interference  effects to acceptable limits may require the use of models of unusually  small size
