1063  on obtaining solutions to the navierstokes equations with high speed digital computers   russell,db  arc 23,797, 1962  on obtaining solutions to the navierstokes equations with high speed digital computers    the purpose of this paper is to show how to obtain steady state solutions to the navierstokes equations on a highspeed digital computer   first the relative merits of various finite difference formulae are discussed   thereafter the main part of the paper is concerned with the methods used to solve the finite difference equations and an investigation is made of all the simpler iterative methods
