7  the effect of controlled threedimensional roughness on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds   van driest,er and mccauley,wd  j ae scs 27, 1960, 261  the effect of controlled threedimensional roughness on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds    experiments were performed in the 12in supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of threedimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundarylayer transition on a tained at local mach numbers of 190, 271, and 367 by varying trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch  the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent flow induced by threedimensional roughness elements begins when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2) transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with increasing roughness height relative to the boundarylayer thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds number to the onefourth power, viz, where x is trip position
