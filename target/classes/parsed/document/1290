1290  measured and calculated subsonic and transonic flutter characteristics of a 45 sweptback wing planform in air and in freon12 in the langley transonic dynamics tunnel   yates,ec, land,ns and foughner,jt  nasa tnd1616, 1963  measured and calculated subsonic and transonic flutter characteristics of a 45 sweptback wing planform in air and in freon12 in the langley transonic dynamics tunnel    in order to investigate the reliability of flutter data measured in the langley transonic dynamics tunnel, an experimental and theoretical subsonic and transonic flutter study has been conducted in air and in freon12 in this facility   the wing planform employed had an aspect ratio of 40, a taper ratio of 06, and 45 of quarterchord sweepback  a stingmounted fullspan model was tested in addition to three sizes of wallmounted semispan models   a wide range of mass ratio was covered by the tests in air and by flutter calculations made by the modified stripanalysis method of naca research memorandum l57l10   a limited amount of data was obtained in freon12    results of the tests in air and in freon12 are in good agreement with the flutter calculations at all mach numbers   the test data compare favorably with previously published transonic flutter data for the same wing planform   the results indicate that flutter characteristics obtained in freon12 may be interpreted directly as equivalent flutter data in air at the same mass ratio and mach number
