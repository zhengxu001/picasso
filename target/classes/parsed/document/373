373  the generalized expansion method and its application to bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds   eggers,aj, savin,rc and syvertson,ca  jaescs 22, 1955, 231  the generalized expansion method and its application to bodies travelling at high supersonic airspeeds    it is demonstrated that the shockexpansion method can be generalized to treat a large class of hypersonic flows, only one of which is flow about airfoils   this generalized method predicts the whole flow field, including shockwave curvatures and resulting vorticity, providing that (1) disturbances originating on the surface of an object are largely absorbed in shock waves with which they interact and (2) disturbances associated with the divergence of stream lines in tangent planes to the surface are of secondary importance compared to those associated with the curvature of stream lines in planes normal to the surface   it is shown that these conditions may be met in threedimensional as well as twodimensional hypersonic flows   when they are met, surface streamlines may be taken as geodesics, which, in turn, may be related to the geometry of the surface    the validity of the generalized shockexpansion method for threedimensional hypersonic flows is checked by comparing predictions of theory with experiment for the surface pressures and bow shock waves of bodies of revolution   the bodies treated are two ogives having fineness ratios of 3 and 5   tests were conducted at mach numbers from 27 to 63 and angles of attack up to 15 degrees in the 10 by 14in supersonic wind tunnel of the ames aeronautical laboratory   at the lower angles of attack, theory and experiment approach agreement when the ratio of mach number to fineness ratiothat is, the hypersonic similarity parameterexceeds 1   at the larger angles of attack, theory tends to break down, as would be expected, on the leeward sides of the bodies    as a final point, it is inquired if the twodimensionality of inviscid hypersonic flows has any counterpart in hypersonic boundarylayer flows   the question is answered in the affirmative, and results of experiment are employed to provide a partial check of this conclusion
