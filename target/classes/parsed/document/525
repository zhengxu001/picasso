525  on hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate with surface mass transfer   tien,cl  j ae scs 29, 1962, 1024  on hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate with surface mass transfer    hypersonic viscous flow over an insulated flat plate with surface mass transfer is studied   the tangentwedge approximation is used in the inviscidflow region, and the integral method is applied to the treatment of the laminar boundary layer   the law of surface mass transfer for the present analysis is derived   a continuous transition of the pressure variation is achieved from the strong to the weak pressureinteraction region   firstorder formulas for the induced surface pressure and the skinfriction coefficient are obtained for both the strong and weak pressureinteraction regions   results are compared with those calculated from other analyses
