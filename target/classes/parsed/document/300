300  on a particular class of similar solutions of the equations of motion and energy of a viscous fluid   reeves,bl and kippenhan,cj  j ae scs 29, 1962  on a particular class of similar solutions of the equations of motion and energy of a viscous fluid    by introducing the similarity concept to the twodimensional, incompressible navierstokes equations and energy equation, a particular class of solutions is found   two general types of flows are considered   (1) laminar free convectionie, flows which take place due to a body forceand (2) laminar forced convection    for free convection on vertical plates, similar solutions are obtained for two different powerlaw surface temperature variations, and it is shown that one of these solutions constitutes a new type of boundary problem   results of numerical integrations of the equations are compared with solutions of the similar boundarylayer equations for free convection, and it is demonstrated that a range of surface temperature variations exists for which the boundary layer equations are no longer valid    for forced convection, it is shown that the use of similarity transformations provides an alternate method of deriving the ordinary differential equations for some wellknown solutions, such as couette and stagnation point flows   solutions are obtained for radial converging or diverging flows between plane surfaces when the temperatures of the surfaces vary as arbitrary powers of the distance from the orgin   results of numerical integrations of the ordinary differential equations are presented for prandtl numbers of 001 and 10 and for linear surface temperature variations   some rather surprising results are obtained for diverging flows when separation occurs and some revealing comparisons with results from boundarylayer theory are made
