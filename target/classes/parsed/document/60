60  estimation forces and moments due to rolling for several slender tail configurations at supersonic speeds   bobbitt,pj and malvestuto,fs  naca tn2955, 1953  estimation forces and moments due to rolling for several slender tail configurations at supersonic speeds    the velocity potentials, span loadings, and corresponding force and moment derivatives have been theoretically evaluated for a number of slendertail arrangements performing a steady rolling motion at supersonic speeds    the method of analysis is based upon an application of conformaltransformation techniques   the utilization of these techniques allows the simple determination of the complex potentials for various types of twodimensional boundaryvalue problems    in addition, two simple and oftenused approximations to the rolling derivatives have been compared with the corresponding exact values determined by the method presented in this report    in order to show the importance of wingtail interference, the effect of the flow field behind a rolling wing on the tail characteristics has been illustrated for a simple wingtail arrangement
