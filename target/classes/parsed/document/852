852  stress and displacement analysis of simply supported non circular cylindrical shell under lateral pressure   romano,f and kempner,j  pibal r415, 1958  stress and displacement analysis of simply supported non circular cylindrical shell under lateral pressure  this paper presents an analysis of the deflections of and stresses in a short noncircular cylindrical shell of uniform wall thickness whose mediansurface cross section is described analytically by a simple expression corresponding to a family of doubly symmetric ovals   the cylinder is under a uniform lateral load and is simply supported at its edges   the small deflection analysis considered is based upon a series solution of appropriate differential equations of shell theory which leads ultimately to infinite sets of algebraic equations, truncated forms of which are considered   numerical values of the significant stresses and displacements for points of the oval cylinder, which are 5 percent of the axial length and 25 percent of the circumferential length apart, have been calculated for an oval cross section with a majorminor axis ratio of 110
