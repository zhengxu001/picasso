783  a method for calculating the subsonic steadystate loading on an airplane with a wing of arbitrary planform and stiffness   gray, wl  naca tn 3030, 1953   a method for calculating the subsonic steadystate loading on an airplane with a wing of arbitrary planform and stiffness  a method for computing the steadystate span load distribution on an elastic airplane wing for specified airplane weights and load factors is  given  the method is based on a modification of the weissinger lmethod and applies at subcritical mach numbers  it includes the effects  of external stores and fuselage on the spanwise loading  modifications are outlined for treating tailboom and tailless airplane configurations and for calculating the divergence dynamic pressure of a swept wing with a large external store  a method is also outlined for reducing windtunnel data to obtain effective aerodynamic coefficients which are free of model flexibility effects  the effects of mach number  can readily be evaluated from the aerodynamic coefficients thus obtained
