709  static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at transonic speeds and angles of attack up to 99degree of a reentry glider having folding wingtip panels   olstad, wb  nasa tm x610, 1961   static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at transonic speeds and angles of attack up to 99degree of a reentry glider having folding wingtip panels  data are presented which were obtained from a transonic windtunnel investigation of a reentry glider having folding wingtip panels  the tests were conducted at angles of attack from 4degrees to 99degrees  the reynolds number based on the mean geometric chord of the fixed planform varied from 235 x 10 to 299 x 10  the maximum liftdrag ratio for the model with the folding wingtip panels fully extended decreased from a maximum value of 78 at a mach number of 060 to about 34 at mach numbers from 103 to 120  the model with the folding wing panels fully extended was stable for values of the lift coefficient from 0 up to at least 08  above this lift coefficient pitchup tendencies were observed, followed by an unstable or neutrally stable region which extended up to values of angle of attack of 50degrees or 60degrees  deflecting the folding wing panels between ducing a significant change in the trim angle of attack or in any of the  force or moment coefficients in the angleofattack range from 49degree to 99degree
