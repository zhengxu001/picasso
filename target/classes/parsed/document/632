632  calculated lift distributions in incompressible flow on some sweptback wings   bagley,ja and joyce,gm  rae tn aero2836, 1962  calculated lift distributions in incompressible flow on some sweptback wings    in the course of a larger survey of some aerodynamic characteristics of a family of sweptback wings, the lowspeed lift distributions were calculated   the 35 planforms considered cover a range of leadingedge sweep angles from 55 to 70, and aspect ratios from 2 to 39   the results are given here, together with a comparison with other calculations and with experimental results on one particular wing
