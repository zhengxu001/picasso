1365  approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer   thwaites,b  aero quart 1, 19491950  approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer    after analyzing a large class of boundarylayer velocityprofiles, the author discovered that the functions l(m) and h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other over the whole range of positive and negative pressure gradients   here l, m and h are defined by being the velocitycomponent in the x direction and u the value of u at the edge of the boundarylayer and and the displacement and momentum thickness, respectively   based on this discovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructing two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable boundarylayer flows found in practice   once these are chosen, karman momentumintegral can be written in the form, v being the kinematic viscosity coefficient, and can be integrated numerically   as examples, both howarth and hartree tained is considered good for practical purposes
