581  approximate formulas for thermalstress analysis   d j johns  lecturer, the college of aeronautics, cranfield, england  approximate formulas for thermalstress analysis  the basis of any thermalstress analysis is the determination of the temperature distributions in the structure   for arbitrary flight histories, the determination of such distributions is rather tedious and not completely general   this latter fact handicaps optimization studies in the project design stage when it is desirable to be able to express the thermalstress distributions in a general manner  in this note, general expressions are derived for the thermalstress distributions in a typical isection using similar assumptions to those of biot
