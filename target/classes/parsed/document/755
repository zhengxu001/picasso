755  oscillatory derivative measurements on stingmounted wind tunnel models method of test and results for pitch and yaw on a cambered ogee wing at mach numbers up to 2 6  thompson,js  rae raero2668, 1962  oscillatory derivative measurements on stingmounted wind tunnel models method of test and results for pitch and yaw on a cambered ogee wing at mach numbers up to 2 6   this report describes a method which has been developed for measuring oscillatory derivatives on stingmounted models in the 8 ft by 8 ft supersonic tunnel at rae bedford   direct and cross derivatives with respect to angular displacements and velocities in pitch and yaw have been measured satisfactorily, and results are given of tests on a cambered ogee wing at six mach numbers from 02 to 26   some tests were made on this model in the course of the preliminary development work in the 13 ft by 9 ft low speed wind tunnel, and results of these are included
