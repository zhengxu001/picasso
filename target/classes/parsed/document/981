981  solutions to the heatconduction equation with time dependent boundary conditions   bergles, ae and kaye, j  j aero sc v 28, march 1961 pp 251252   solutions to the heatconduction equation with time dependent boundary conditions  design charts based on the analytical solution to the problem of onedimensional heat flow in a solid body of constant material properties with timedependent boundary conditions were presented by kaye and yeh  this solution dealt with aerodynamic heating at hypersonic speeds where the surface coefficient of heat transfer and the temperature potential were taken to be linear functions of time of flight  in order  to make these charts of more general application, general solutions are  presented which, together with the charts, enable rapid and reasonable estimates to be made of the transient temperature distributions in many practical cases
