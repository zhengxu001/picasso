675  pressure distribution and surface flow on 5( and 9( thick wings with curved tip and 60degree sweepback   garner, hc and walshe, de  arc 20,982, r + m 3244 may 1959   pressure distribution and surface flow on 5( and 9( thick wings with curved tip and 60degree sweepback  extensive tables are given of pressure coefficients measured at reynolds  numbers from 13x10 to 39x10 on two halfmodels of identical planform with 5( rae 101 and 9( rae 101 streamwise sections  the planform of aspect ratio 3899 has a straight trailing edge with 60degree of sweepback, constant chord over most of the span and a parabolic outer portion of the leading edge curving to a pointed tip  the overall wing characteristics are obtained from integrated normal pressures and are compared with liftingsurface theory  the lowspeed experimental pressure distributions and surface oilflow patterns are analysed and discussed in relation to the onset of separation and the distinct vortex flows that develop at high incidence  series of contrasting uppersurface isobars illustrate some features of the different stalling processes of the two wings  the direct influence of the main vortex on local surface pressures is assessed in general terms  a fuller appraisal of secondary surface flow  is obtained from the oil patterns, observations in water and measurements of high suction near the trailing edge  studies of the extent of leadingedge stall and location of partspan vortices, in particular two simultaneous leadingedge vortices on the thinner wing, follow from further analysis of local surface pressures  after a detailed discussion of the effect of reynolds number and the distinct types of separated flow, a few results with leadingedge roughness are considered in relation to scale effect on separation and the extensive influence of partspan roughness
