991  wingflow study of pressure drag reduction at transonic speed by projecting a jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid of fineness ratio 6   lopatoff, m  naca rm l51e09, 1951   wingflow study of pressure drag reduction at transonic speed by projecting a jet of air from the nose of a prolate spheroid of fineness ratio 6  a study was made at transonic speeds by the naca wingflow method of the  pressuredrag reduction obtained by projecting a highenergy jet of air  from the nose of a prolate spheroid  supplementary information was obtained by taking shadowgraphs of the model mounted in a small supersonic tunnel at a constant mach number of 15  the highvelocity jet was observed to alter the pressure distribution over the body in such a way that the pressure drag of the body was reduced, thus, in a restricted sense, the nose jet produced a thrust on  the body  under the conditions investigated, the thrust produced by the nose jet was never so large as that which would be expected from a conventional rearward jet  for example, under the best conditions tested /mach number of 107/ the reduction in body pressure drag caused by the nose jet more than compensated for the negative thrust of the jet  itself  however, the magnitude of the net reduction in drag /change in  body pressure drag with jet on and jet off minus the adverse thrust of the jet/ was only about onehalf of the thrust which would be produced by the same jet exhausting rearward  the appearance of such an unexpectedly large effect in the first trial indicated the phenomenon to be worth further study
