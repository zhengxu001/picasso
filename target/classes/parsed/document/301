301  approximate design of sharpcornered supersonic nozzles   m a rahman  nack and sunderland consulting mech and elec engineers  approximate design of sharpcornered supersonic nozzles  a modified parabolic curve appears to be in close proximity to that obtained by either the method of characteristics or the wave method  thus an attempt has been made to use analytic geometry to determine approximately the contour of a twodimensional, sharpcornered supersonic nozzle in a very short time
