721  near noise field of a jet engine exhaust   callaghan,ee, howes,wl coles,wd and mull,rh  naca r1338  near noise field of a jet engine exhaust    aircraft structures located in the near noise field of a jet engine are subjected to extremely high fluctuating pressures that may cause structural fatigue   studies of such structures have been limited by lack of knowledge of the loadings involved    the acoustic near field produced by the exhaust of a stationary turbojet engine having a high pressure ratio was measured for a single operating condition without afterburning   the maximum overall sound pressure without afterburning was found to be about 42 pounds per square foot along the jet boundary in the region immediately downstream of the jetnozzle exit  with afterburning the maximum sound pressure was increased by 50 percent   the largest sound pressures without afterburning were obtained on a constant percentage band width basis in the frequency range from 350 to 700 cps    additional tests were made at a few points to find the effect of jet velocity on nearfield sound pressures and to determine the difference in value between soundpressure levels at rigid surfaces and corresponding freefield values   near the jet nozzle, overall sound pressures were found to vary as a low power (approx unity) of the jet velocity   overall soundpressure levels considerably greater than the corresponding freefield levels were recorded at the surface of a rigid plate placed along the jet boundary    the downstream locations of the maximum sound pressure at any given frequency along the jetengineexhaust boundary and the longitudinal turbulentvelocity maximum of the same frequency along a small coldair jet at 1 nozzleexit radius from the jet axis were found to be nearly the same when compared on a dimensionless basis   also, the strouhal number of the corresponding spectra maximums was found to be nearly equal at similar distances downstream    in addition to the magnitude and frequency distribution of the acoustic pressures, it is necessary to know the cross correlation of the pressure over the surface area   crosscorrelation measurements with microphones were made for a range of jet velocities at locations along the jet and at a distance from the jet   freefield correlations of the overall sound pressure and of the sound pressure in frequency bands from 100 to 1000 cps were obtained both longitudinally and laterally   in addition, correlations were obtained with microphones mounted at the surface of a rigid plate that was large compared with the distance over which a positive correlation existed    the region of positive correlation was generally found to increase with distance downstream of the engine to 65 nozzleexit diameters, but remained nearly constant thereafter   in general, little change in the correlation curves was found as a function of jet velocity or frequencyband width   the distance from unity correlation to the first zero correlation was greater for lateral than for longitudinal correlations for the same conditions and locations   the correlation curves obtained in free space and on the surface of the plate were generally similar    the results are interpreted in terms of pressure loads on surfaces
