306  second approximation to laminar compressible boundary layer on flat plate in slip flow   maslen,sh  naca tn2818, 1952  second approximation to laminar compressible boundary layer on flat plate in slip flow    the firstorder solution for the laminar compressible boundarylayer flow over a flat plate at constant wall temperature is given   the effect of slip at the wall as well as the interaction between the boundarylayer flow and the outer stream flow are taken into consideration   the solution is obtained explicitly in terms of the known zero order, or continuum, solution   no assumptions regarding the prandtl number or viscositytemperature law need be made   it is found that the firstorder solution gives a decrease in heat transfer and, for supersonic flow, an increase in skin friction  for subsonic flow there is no firstorder shear effect   the change in heat transfer is due to slip and the change in friction is due to the interaction of the zero and firstorder velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer
