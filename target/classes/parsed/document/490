490  normalshock relations in magnetohydrodynamics   gundersen,rm  jaescs29, 1962, 997  normalshock relations in magnetohydrodynamics    the magneticfield vector is perpendicular to the flow direction, thus for normal shocks there is no change of flow direction through the shock front   this class of shocks is included in investigations by several authors (five are referred to here), but the presentation here is thought to be especially convenient   all downstream quantities are given in terms of upstream flow conditions, including the upstream ratio of alfven speed to sound speed, and the shock strength (density ratio)
