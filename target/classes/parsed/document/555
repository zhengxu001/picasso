555  closing reply to comments on generalized heat transfer formulas and graphs for nose cone reentry into the atmosphere   hidalgo,h  ars j 1962  closing reply to comments on generalized heat transfer formulas and graphs for nose cone reentry into the atmosphere  in a recent paper (1), detra and hidalgo have shown that, when the boundary layer is turbulent, the heat flux per unit area at the sonic point of a nose cone may exceed the corresponding laminar heat flux per unit area at the stagnation point   the ratio of turbulent sonicpoint to laminar stagnationpoint heat flux per unit area has been estimated (2) to vary from about 10 to 10 for a hemispherical nose as the reynolds number (based on nose diameter) increases from 10 to 10   since for an axisymmetric body the surface area in the vicinity of the sonic point greatly exceeds the area in the vicinity of the stagnation point, the ratio of turbulent to laminar heat fluxes to the entire body will be much greater than the above quoted ratios of heat fluxes per unit area
