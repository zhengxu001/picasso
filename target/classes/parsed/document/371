371  note on tipbluntness effects in the supersonic and hypersonic regimes   bennett,fd  j ae scs 24, 1957, 314  note on tipbluntness effects in the supersonic and hypersonic regimes  in a recent letter, m h bertram presents some data on flows at m = 685 around 10 halfangle cones with blunted tips   since the demarcation between the supersonic and hypersonic regimes is not sharp and since one expects hypersonic flows to be generally similar to those at lower mach numbers especially where viscous effects do not predominate throughout the entire field of interestit is of some value to compare bertram results with those obtained by giese and bergdolt for 15 halfangle cones at m = 245   following the observation by charters and stein that drag coefficient measurements on blunted cones imply a reynolds number effect, giese and bergdolt study the convergence to conical flow of the perturbed flow about a cone with truncated tip   they employ the machzehnder interferometer and the conical flow criterion as analytical tools
