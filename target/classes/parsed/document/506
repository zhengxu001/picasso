506  a note on havelock shallowwater waveresistance curves   brandmaier,he  j ae scs 29, 1962, 257  a note on havelock shallowwater waveresistance curves  in the continuous quest for improved means of transportation, attention is currently focused on the groundeffect machine   as there is no physical contact between the vehicle and the terrain over which it operates, its performance should be similar over land and water   however, over water there is an additional resistance to motion due to the gravitywave system generated by the supporting or /cushion/ pressure acting on the water surface   estimates of this component can be made using the analysis of t h havelock   it is the purpose of this note to present an ibm 650 digitalcomputer solution of his equations   as shown below, these results differ from havelock original results
