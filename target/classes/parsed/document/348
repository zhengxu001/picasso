348  turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids   van driest,er  jaescs 18, 1951, 145  turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids    the continuity, momentum, and energy differential equations for turbulent flow of a compressible fluid are derived, and the apparent turbulent stresses and dissipation function are identified   a general formula for skin friction, including heat transfer to a flat plate, is developed for a thin turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids with zero pressure gradient   curves are presented giving skinfriction coefficients and heattransfer coefficients for air for various walltofreestream temperature ratios and freestream mach numbers    in the special case when the boundary layer is insulated, this general formula yields skinfriction coefficients higher than those given by the von karman wallproperty compressiblefluid formula but lower than those given by the von karman incompressiblefluid formula   heat transfer from the boundary layer to the plate generally increases the friction and heattransfer coefficients
