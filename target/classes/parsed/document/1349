1349  effects of simulated rocket jet exhaust on stability and control of a research type airplane configuration at a mach number of 6 86   fetterman,de  nasa tmx127, 1959  effects of simulated rocket jet exhaust on stability and control of a research type airplane configuration at a mach number of 6 86    an investigation has been undertaken in the langley 11inch hypersonic tunnel at a freestream mach number of 686 to determine the jetinterference effects at high jetstaticpressure ratios on the stability and control of a researchtype airplane configuration  compressedair tests with a jet exhausting from the base of the fuselage were conducted over a reynolds number range of 057 x 10 to and over a jetstatic pressureratio range of 0 to 1460   the results of these tests indicated that the operation of the jet induced a sizable separatedflow region over the vertical and horizontaltail surfaces which could be approximately duplicated at low angles of attack by use of metal jetboundary simulators   the results of force tests, during which these metal jetboundary simulators were used, indicated that this separatedflow region caused a large reduction in the longitudinal stability and control and a smaller reduction in the lateral and directional stability and control   by extending the divergent section of the nozzle and thus reducing the jetstaticpressure ratio, these losses were diminished
