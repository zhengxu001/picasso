732  on the analogues relating flexure and extension of flat plates   southwell,rv  q j mech app math 3, 1950, 257  on the analogues relating flexure and extension of flat plates    the displacement of a flat plate bent by transverse loading, and the extensional or in 'plane stress', are governed by equations of identical form , and the boundary conditions have identical form when edgedisplacements are specified in the flexural, edgetractions in the extensional problem, so mathematically, in these circumstances, only a single problem is presented   this, the 'first analogue' relating flexure and extension, is well known    a econd analogue', relating the flexural problem when edgetractions with the extensional problem when edgedisplacements are specified, is believed to have been first propounded in 1941   by introducing two quantities u and v, analogous with the components u and v of extensional displacement, it permits a treatment of the flexural problem by any methodeg which yields extensional solutions of this second type    in this paper both analogues are combined in an inclusive statement covering the perforated (multiply connected) plates which were discussed in 1948   reasons are stated for believing that 'twodiagram technique' is preferable in problems governed by 'mixed' boundary conditions
