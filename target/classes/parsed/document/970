970  loads induced on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to a freestream flow of mach number 20   janos, jj  nasa tn d649, march 1961   loads induced on a flat plate wing by an air jet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to a freestream flow of mach number 20  measurements were made of loads induced on a flatplate wing by an air jet exhausting perpendicularly through the wing and normal to the freestream flow  the investigation was conducted at a freestream mach number of 20 and a reynolds number per foot of 144 x 10  an axially symmetric sonic nozzle and two supersonic nozzles were employed for the jets  the supersonic nozzles consisted of an axially symmetric nozzle with exit mach number of 344 and a twodimensional nozzle with exit mach number of 176  the ratio of nozzle total pressure to freestream static pressure was varied from 20 to 110  negative loads were induced on the flatplate wing by all the jets  as the nozzle pressure ratio was increased the magnitude of interference loads due to jet thrust decreased  the chordwise centerofpressure location generally moved toward the nozzle center line as the pressure ratio was increased
