1315  performance estimates for the rae 6in  highpressure shock tube   woods,na  arc 20,440, 1958  performance estimates for the rae 6in  highpressure shock tube    estimates are made of the performance of the rae 6'' high pressure shock tube, with various driver gases, over a range of pressure ratios giving shock mach numbers from 6 to 22   the calculations are based on a simplified model of shock tube flow, in which the working fluid (argonfree air) is assumed to be always in chemical equilibrium, and the driver gas (either hydrogen, or the products of combustion of a hydrogenoxygen mixture) is assumed to behave as an ideal gas with constant specifiic heats    the results are presented in graphical form and comprise charts normal shock waves in argonfree air shock wave mach number and diaphragm pressure ratio under various initial conditions, and of the shockinduced flows, both in the uniformsectioned shock tube, and when expanded in a divergent nozzle
