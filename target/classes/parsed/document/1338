1338  investigation to determine effects of center of gravity location on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree sweptback wing   jones, gw and unangst, jr  naca rm l55k30, 1956   investigation to determine effects of center of gravity location on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree sweptback wing  an experimental investigation has been conducted in the 26inch langley transonic blowdown tunnel to determine effects of centerofgravity location on the transonic flutter characteristics of a 45degree sweptbackwing plan form of aspect ratio 40 and taper ratio 06  solidconstruction models of the plan form with streamwise naca 65a004 airfoil sections and centerofgravity locations at approximately 34 percent chord, 46 percent chord, and 58 percent chord, respectively, were fluttered at several mach numbers between 08 and 135  it was found that, for streamwise mach numbers from 08 to 10, the variation with mach number of the ratio of experimental flutter speed to  a calculated incompressible flutter speed was not affected by centerofgravity location  however, for mach numbers from 10 to 135, there was an increase in flutterspeed ratio with mach number which was different for each centerofgravity position  data from wings with successively more forward centerofgravity locations showed successively larger values of flutterspeed ratio at mach numbers from 10 to
