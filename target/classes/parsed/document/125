125  measurements of skin friction of the compressible turbulent boundary layer on a cone with foreign gas injection   pappas,cc and okuno,af  jaeroscs 27, 1960, 321  measurements of skin friction of the compressible turbulent boundary layer on a cone with foreign gas injection    measurements of average skin friction of the turbulent boundary layer have been made on a 15 total included angle cone with foreign gas injection   measurements of total skinfriction drag were obtained at freestream mach numbers of 03, 07, 35, and x 10 with injection of helium, air, and freon12 through the porous wall   substantial reductions in skin friction are realized with gas injection within the range of mach numbers of this test   the relative reduction in skin friction is in accordance with theorythat is, the light gases are most effective when compared on a mass flow basis   there is a marked effect of mach number on the reduction of average skin friction, this effect is not shown by the available theories   limited transition location measurements indicate that the boundary layer does not fully trip with gas injection but that the transition point approaches a forward limit with increasing injection   the variation of the skinfriction coefficient, for the lower injection rates with natural transition, is dependent on the flow reynolds number and type of injected gas, and at the high injection rates the skin friction is in fair agreement with the turbulent boundarylayer results
