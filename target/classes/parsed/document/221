221  a theoretical study of annular supersonic nozzles   lord,wt  arc r + m 3227, 1961  a theoretical study of annular supersonic nozzles    this paper is concerned with the design of annular supersonic nozzles to produce uniform flow in supersonic wind tunnels which are axisymmetrical and which have an internal coaxial circular cylinder throughout   symmetrical twodimensional and conventional axisymmetrical nozzles are special cases of annular nozzles    proposals are made for design criteria sufficient to ensure that the flow inside a nozzle is free from limit lines and shock waves, the criteria for (symmetrical) twodimensional and (conventional) axisymmetrical nozzles are new   the two outstanding procedures for designing twodimensional and axisymmetrical nozzles are generalised to apply to annular nozzles   one of the design procedures is mainly analytical and the other is mainly numerical, the analytical expressions in both procedures are made much more complicated by the presence of the internal cylinder but the numerical process criteria and the mainly numerical design procedure are successfully applied to the design of a particular annular nozzle
