1006  freeflight measurements of the static and dynamic     freeflight measurements of the static and dynamic    the inviscid flow of a perfect gas over bluntnosed axisymmetric and twodimensional bodies at zero angle of attack has been calculated numerically on an ibm 7090 computer   the computation consisted of the fuller bluntbody solution for the subsonic and transonic regions and the method of characteristics for the supersonic region   the flow fields about a number of blunt bodies were studied, and the calculated results showed good agreement with experimental shockwave shapes, surfacepressure distributions, and flowfield surveys
