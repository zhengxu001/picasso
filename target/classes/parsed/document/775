775  studies on two dimensional flows of compressible fluid    studies on two dimensional flows of compressible fluid   it is wellknown that when the flow is everywhere subsonic in a field of flow, the nature of the twodimensional isentropic flow of a compressible perfect fluid differs only slightly from that of the corresponding flow of an incompressible perfect fluid   thus, in such a case, we can calculate the field of flow by any of the wellknown methods of approximation   on the other hand, if the flow is supersonic throughout the field, we can determine the flow pattern by the method of characteristics
