692  investigation of the jet effects on a flat surface downstream of the exit of a simulated turbojet nacelle at a freestream mach number of 202   bressette, we  naca rm l54e05a, 1954   investigation of the jet effects on a flat surface downstream of the exit of a simulated turbojet nacelle at a freestream mach number of 202  an investigation at a freestream mach number of 202 was made to determine the effects of a propulsive jet on a wing surface located in the vicinity of a choked convergent nozzle  staticpressure surveys were made on a flat surface that was located in the vicinity of the propulsive jet  the nozzle was operated over a range of exit pressure ratios at different fixed vertical distances from the flat surface  within the scope of this investigation, it was found that shock waves, formed in the external flow because of the presence of the propulsive jet, impinged on the flat surface and greatly altered the pressure distribution  an integration of this pressure distribution, with the location of the propulsive jet exit varied from 1450 propulsivejet exit diameters to 3392 propulsivejet exit diameters below the wing, resulted in an incremental lift for all jet locations that was equal to the gross thrust at an exit pressure ratio of 286  this incremental lift increased with increase in exit pressure ratio, but not so rapidly as the thrust increased, and was approximately constant at any given exit pressure ratio
