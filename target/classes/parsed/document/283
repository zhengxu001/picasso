283  laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociated air   kemp,nh, rose,ph and detra,rw  jaesc 26, 1959  laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociated air    a method of predicting laminar heattransfer rates to blunt, highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociated air flow is developed   attention is restricted to the case of axisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although twodimensional bodies could be treated the same way   the method is based on the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the ideas used by fay and riddell   a simple formula is given for predicting the ratio of local heattransfer rate to stagnationpoint rate   it depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution, but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hot external flow, except at the stagnation point    experimental heattransfer rates obtained with correct stagnationpoint simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes are also presented and compared with the theoretical predictions  on the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions of rapidly varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarity assumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates the actual heattransfer rate by up to 25 per cent
