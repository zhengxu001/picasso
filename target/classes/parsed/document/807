807  ground measurements of the shock wave noise from supersonic bomber airplanes in the altitude range from 30,000 to 50,000 feet   maglieri,dj and hubbard,hh  nasa tnd880, 1961  ground measurements of the shock wave noise from supersonic bomber airplanes in the altitude range from 30,000 to 50,000 feet    shockwave groundpressure measurements have been made for supersonic bomber airplanes in the mach number range from 124 to 152, for altitudes from about 30,000 to 50,000 feet, and for a grossweight range from about 83,000 to 120,000 pounds   the measured overpressures were generally higher than would be predicted by the theory which accounts only for volume effects   there is thus a suggestion that lift effects on sonicboom intensity may be significant for this type of airplane for the altitude range of the present tests
