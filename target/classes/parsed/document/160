160  approximate analytical solutions for hypersonic flow past slender powerlaw bodies   mirels,h  nasa r15, 1959  approximate analytical solutions for hypersonic flow past slender powerlaw bodies  approximate analytical solutions are presented for twodimensional and axisymmetric hypersonic flow over bluntnosed slender bodies whose shapes follow a power law variation   in particular, the body shape is given by where is the transverse body ordinate, is the streamwise distance from the nose, and m is a constant in the range  both zeroorder solutions and firstorder (small but nonvanishing values of solutions are presented, where m is the freestream mach number and is a characteristic body or streamline slope   the zeroorder shock shape is similar to the body shape for these flows   the solutions are found within the framework of hypersonicslenderbody theory    the limiting case m=1 corresponds to a wedge or cone flow   the limiting case corresponds to a constantenergy flow  the latter cases are included so that the present study may be applied to all flows wherein the zeroorder shock shape is given by with m in the range   flow fields associated with shock shapes having values of m outside this range are also discussed   for all values of, except m=1, certain portions of the flow field riolate the hypersonicslenderbody approximations, while other portions are consistent with these approximations   for m=1, all portions of the flow field are consistent with the approximations    the approximate solutions are found as follows  the asymptotic form of the flow in the vicinity of the body surface is used as a guide to write approximate expressions for the dependent variables   these expressions exactly satisfy the continuity and energy equations and contain arbitrary constants which are evaluated so as to satisfy boundary conditions at the shock   the approximate solutions do not satisfy the lateral momentum equation except at the shock and (for the firstorder problem) at the body surface    the results of the approximate solutions are compared with numerical integrations of the equations of motion for various values of m and (ratio of specific heats)   good agreement is noted, particularly when m and are both near one   the shock is relatively close to the body for the latter cases   sufficient results are presented to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate method for various values of m and
