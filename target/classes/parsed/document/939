939  some explicit solutions for constanttemp  magnetogas dynamic channel flow   berlot,rr  j ae scs 29, 1962, 748  some explicit solutions for constanttemp  magnetogas dynamic channel flow  in order to simplify the process of estimating the aerodynamic loading on the after portions of slender vehicles, it is frequently assumed that there is no nosetail interaction   it is the purpose of this note to show that, aside from boundarylayer effects, this assumption is not warranted when the nose hypersonicsimilarity parameter, tan, is of the order of unity, or greater   physically speaking, the entropy change associated with a strong bow wave reduces the stagnation pressure downstream of the shock, and hence, lowers the dynamic pressure in the vicinity of the tail
