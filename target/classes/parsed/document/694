694  pressure distribution induced on a flat plate by a supersonic and sonic jet exhaust at a freestream mach number of 180   leiss, a and bressette, we  naca rm l56106, 1957   pressure distribution induced on a flat plate by a supersonic and sonic jet exhaust at a freestream mach number of 180  as a continuation of previous research at mach numbers of 202 and 139,  an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on a flat plate by a propulsive jet exhausting from sonic and supersonic nozzles at a freestream mach number of 180  measurements of the pressure distribution on a flatplate wing were made at zero angle of attack for four different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneath the wing  both a choked convergent nozzle and a convergentdivergent nozzle on the nacelle were used  the nozzles were operated at nacelleexit totalpressure ratios from 2 to 16 and the reynolds number per foot  was approximately 13 x 10  two distinct shock waves impinged on the wing surface and greatly altered the pressure distribution at all nozzle positions  positive incremental normal force resulted on the wing at all positions  comparisons are presented for two freestream mach numbers
