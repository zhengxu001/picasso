295  a note on transitional heat transfer under hypersonic conditions   constantino economos and paul a libby  research assistant and professor of aeronautical engineering, respectively polytechnic institute of brooklyn, brooklyn, ny  a note on transitional heat transfer under hypersonic conditions  in references 1 and 2 there were presented experimental data on transitional heat transfer on a blunt body under hypersonicflow conditions obtained by the shroud technique   the data were compared with a theoretical prediction of transitional heat transfer based on a suggestion of persh   the agreement between theory and experiment in the transitional region was found to be 'qualitatively good and quantitatively fair'  it is the purpose of this note to present some additional transitional data obtained in conventional windtunnel tests and to indicate a means for improving somewhat the agreement between transitional theory and experiment
