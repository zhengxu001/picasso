292  rapid laminar boundary layer calculations by piecewise application of similar solutions   smith,amo  j ae scs 23, 1956  rapid laminar boundary layer calculations by piecewise application of similar solutions    a method is presented for the rapid calculation of the incompressible laminar boundary layer in an arbitrary flow around either a twodimensional or a rotationallysymmetrical body  the solution is obtained without recourse to von karman momentum equation by means of a coarse stepbystep procedure in which each segment of the velocity distribution is approximated by one of the falknerskan family of similar flows    solutions have at least as much accuracy as those of any other oneparameter approximate method, and in certain cases the solutions become exact   in regions of accelerating velocity, the accuracy appears to be very high   in decelerating flows, separation is predicted somewhat early compared with exact solutions that is, the method is conservative in contrast to the von karmanpohlhausen procedure which sometimes fails to predict separation that actually exists    the method is the most rapid hand procedure known to the author, provided the full history of the boundary layer is required   if only a thickness such as is needed at one point on a surface, then it is about equal in speed to the quadrature method  but, if several values of or other properties along a surface are required, it is appreciably faster than the quadrature method  characteristically, only four steps are needed between the forward stagnation point and the pressure peak   once the velocitydistribution data are available, each step in a twodimensional calculation requires about 5 minutes, using a slide rule
