377  a turbulent analog of the stewartsonillingworth transformation   culick,fe and hill,j  j ae scs 25, 1958  a turbulent analog of the stewartsonillingworth transformation    the stewartsonillingworth transformation is applied to the integral momentum equation for compressible boundarylayer flow, leaving the xcoordinate transformation unspecified, however   it is shown that the transformed equation is the integral momentum equation for incompressible flow if (a) the effect of compressibility on the boundarylayer shape parameter h can be represented by and (b) the xcoordinate transformation is chosen to be suitably related to the ratio of skinfriction coefficients in compressible and incompressible flows    experimental evidence is presented which shows that condition (a) is satisfied for turbulent boundary layers up to m = 5  an xtransformation is chosen according to (b) and an equation is presented which gives the turbulent boundarylayer growth in compressible flow in terms of a simple quadrature   the predictions of this equation are then compared with some measurements on windtunnel nozzles
