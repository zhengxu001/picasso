1001  wind tunnel investigation of the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a 10degree semivertex angle blunted cone   wehrend, wr  nasa tn d1202, 1962   wind tunnel investigation of the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a 10degree semivertex angle blunted cone  the static and dynamic stability characteristics of a blunted 10degree semivertex angle cone were studied  the cone which had a modified spherical segment nose was tested with a flat base and with a truncated conical base  all tests were performed in air at mach numbers from 065 to 220 with the angleofattack range from 4degree to +18degree  presented are measurements of the normal force, axial force, base pressure, and pitching moment from the static tests, and the dampinginpitch moment from the dynamic tests  both models had satisfactory stability characteristics throughout the test mach number range but the addition of the conical afterbody had a large destabilizing effect
