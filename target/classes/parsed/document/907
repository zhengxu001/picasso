907  cavitation and pressure distribution head forms at zero angle of yaw   hunter rouse and john s mcnown  iowa institute of hydraulic research, state university of iowa iowa city  cavitation and pressure distribution head forms at zero angle of yaw  early in the fall of 1943 the iowa institute of hydraulic research undertook the design and fabrication of a variablepressure water tunnel   as the tunnel neared completion, however, its immediate use for the study of the pressure distribution around various body forms was requested  the original request for this investigation was a natural outgrowth of the need for systematic data on the distribution of pressure in flow around various bodies, particularly under conditions leading to cavitation, information which is desirable for the design of a wide variety of navy equipment   ultimately the study is to include data for two and threedimensional head and tail forms at various angles of yaw   the first phase of the study, namely the investigation of threedimensional head forms at zero angle of yaw, is described herein  three general geometric series have been studieddash rounded, ellipsoidal, and conicaldash together with other related forms  the data obtained have been systematized to yield information for a wide variety of geometrical forms either directly or by interpolation   whenever possible, analytical methods have been used to corroborate the experimental data and to provide a reliable means of generalizing the results
