686  flutter tests of some simple models at a mach number of 7 2 in helium flow   morgan,hg and miller,rw  nasa memo 4859l, 1959  flutter tests of some simple models at a mach number of 7 2 in helium flow    results of hypersonic flutter tests on some simple models are presented   the models had rectangular plan forms of panel aspect ratio 10, no sweepback, and bendingtotorsion frequency ratios of about   two airfoil sections were included in the tests , double wedges of 5, 10, and 15percent thickness and flat plates with straight, parallel sides and beveled leading and trailing edges  the models were supported by a cantilevered shaft    the doublewedge wings were tested in helium at a mach number of 72  an effect of airfoil thickness on flutter speed was found, thicker wings requiring more stiffness to avoid flutter  a few tests in air at a mach number of 69 showed the same thickness effect and also indicated that tests in helium would predict conservative flutter boundaries in air  the data in air and helium seemed to be correlated by pistontheory calculations   pistontheory calculations agreed well with experiment for the thinner models but began to deviate as the thickness parameter approached and exceeded 10    a few tests on flatplate models with various elasticaxis locations were made   pistontheory calculations would not satisfactorily predict the flutter of these models, probably because of their blunt leading edges
