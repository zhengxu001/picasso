1341  investigation of wing flutter at transonic speeds for six systematically  varied wing plan forms   jones, gw and dubose, hc  naca rml53g10a, 1953   investigation of wing flutter at transonic speeds for six systematically  varied wing plan forms  an investigation of the effects of systematic variations in wing plan form on the flutter speed at mach numbers between 073 and 143 has been  conducted in the 26inch langley transonic blowdown tunnel  the angle of sweepback was varied from 0degree to 60degree on wings of aspect ratio 4, and the aspect ratio was varied from 2 to 6 on wings with experimental flutter speed and the reference flutter speed calculated on  the basis of incompressible twodimensional flow  this ratio, designated as the flutterspeed ratio, is plotted as a function of mach number for the various wings  it is found that the flutterspeed ratio increased rapidly past sonic speed for sweep angles of 45degree and less, indicating a favorable effect of mach number  for sweepback of mach number range of the tests  reducing the aspect ratio had a favorable effect on the flutterspeed ratio which was of the order of 100 percent higher for the aspectratio2 wing than for the aspectratio6 wing  this percentage difference was nearly constant throughout the mach number range, indicating that the effect of mach number was about the same for all aspect ratios tested
