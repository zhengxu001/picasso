234  a second order shockexpansion method applicable to bodies of revolution near zero lift   syvertson,ca and denis,dh  naca tn3527  a second order shockexpansion method applicable to bodies of revolution near zero lift    a secondorder shockexpansion method applicable to bodies of revolution near zero lift is developed  expressions defining the pressures on noninclined bodies are derived by the use of characteristics theory in combination with properties of the flow predicted by the generalized shockexpansion method   this result is extended to inclined bodies to obtain expressions for the normalforce and pitchingmoment derivatives at zero angle of attack   the method is intended for application under conditions between the ranges of applicability of the secondorder potential theory and the generalized shockexpansion mehtod  namely, when the ratio of freestream mach number to nose fineness ratio is in the neighborhood of 1    for noninclined bodies, the pressure distributions predicted by the secondorder shockexpansion method are compared with existing experimental results and with predictions of other theories   for inclined bodies, the normalforce derivatives and locations of the center of pressure at zero angle of attack predicted by the method are compared with experimental results for mach numbers from 300 to 628  fineness ratio 7, 5, and 3 cones and tangent ogives were tested alone and with cylindrical afterbodies up to 10 diameters long   in general, the predictions of the present method are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results   for noninclined bodies, pressure distributions predicted with the method are in good agreement with existing experimental results and with distributions obtained with the method of characteristics  for inclined bodies, the normalforce derivatives per radian (for normalforce coefficients referenced to body base area) are predicted within 02 and the locations of the center of pressure are predicted within 02 body diameters   on the basis of these results, the secondorder shockexpansion method appears applicable for values of the ratio of freestream mach number to nose fineness ratio from 04 to 2
