205  a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamic loads measured on a 45 sweptback wing at subsonic mach numbers   walker,hj and maillard,wc  naca rm a55c08, 1955  a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamic loads measured on a 45 sweptback wing at subsonic mach numbers    an investigation has been made of the possibility of correlating airfoil section data with measured pressure distributions over a 45 sweptback wing in the mach number range from 050 to 095 at a freestream reynolds number of approximately 2 million  the wing had an aspect ratio of 55, a taper ratio of 053, naca 64a010 sections normal to the quarterchord line, and was mounted on a slender body of revolution    at mach numbers of 085 and below, and for wing normalforce coefficients below the maximum normalforce coefficient for an infiniteaspectratio wing yawed 45 to the flow (derived from airfoil section data by simple sweep relations), good correlation was obtained over most of the wing between wingsection and twodimensionalairfoil pressure distributions   for greater normalforce coefficients lateral boundarylayer flow permitted the inboard wing sections to rise to high maximum section normalforce coefficients   the effectiveness of this lateral boundarylayer flow disappeared towards the tip   for all mach numbers, the influence of planform effects on the pressure distributions limited the quality of the correlation at the 20 and 95percentsemispan stations   above a mach number of about 085 the shock waves originating at the juncture of the body and the wing trailing edge spread over the span, preventing further application of twodimensional data    the spanwise load distributions at moderate normalforce coefficients could be predicted from spanloading theory for the entire mach number range of the tests
