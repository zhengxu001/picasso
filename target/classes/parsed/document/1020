1020  note on creep buckling of columns     note on creep buckling of columns    the results of shorttime creepbuckling and creepbending tests of slenderness ratio 111 are presented  the tests were performed at 600 f, and strain measurements were taken with hightemperature electricresistance strain gages   a description of the development of the gages is given in an appendix   the column tests show that the critical time decreases much more rapidly with increasing load than with increasing initial deviation from straightness  the bending tests indicate that the steady creep rate of the curvature is a simple power function of applied moment   these latter results, together with a previously derived creepbuckling theory, are used to develop a semiempirical formula suitable as a guide for the determination of the critical time for columns
