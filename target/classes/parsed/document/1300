1300  some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition and heat transfer at supersonic speeds   moeckel,we  naca r1312, 1957  some effects of bluntness on boundary layer transition and heat transfer at supersonic speeds    large downstream movements of transition observed when the leading edge of a hollow cylinder or a flat plate is slightly blunted are explained in terms of the reduction in reynolds number at the outer edge of the boundary layer due to the detached shock wave   the magnitude of this reduction is computed for cones and wedges for mach numbers to 20  concurrent changes in outeredge mach number and temperature occur in the direction that would increase the stability of the laminar boundary layer    the hypothesis is made that transition reynolds number is substantially unchanged when a sharp leading edge or tip is blunted   this hypothesis leads to the conclusion that the downstream movement of transition is inversely proportional to the ratio of surface reynolds number with blunted tip or leading edge to surface reynolds number with sharp tip or leading edge   this conclusion is in good agreement with the hollowcylinder result at mach 31    application of this hypothesis to other mach numbers yields the result that blunting the tip of a slender cone or the leading edge of a thin wedge should produce downstream movements of transition by factors ranging from 2 at mach 30 to 30 at mach the possible reduction in overall heattransfer rate and friction drag for aircraft flying at high supersonic speeds    mach number profiles near the surfaces of blunted cones and wedges are computed for an assumed shape of the detached shock wave at flight mach numbers to 20   the dissipation and stability of these profiles are discussed, and a method is described for estimating the amount of blunting required to produce the maximum possible downstream movement of transition
