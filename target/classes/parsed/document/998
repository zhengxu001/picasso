998  equations, tables and charts for compressible flow   ames research staff  naca r1135, 1953  equations, tables and charts for compressible flow    this report, which is a revision and extension of naca tn useful in the analysis of highspeed flow of a compressible fluid  the equations provide relations for continuous onedimensional flow, normal and oblique shock waves, and prandtlmeyer expansions for both perfect and imperfect gases   the tables present useful dimensionless ratios for continuous one dimensional flow and for normal shock waves as functions of mach number for air considered as a perfect gas   one series of charts presents the characteristics of the flow of air (considered a perfect gas) for oblique shock waves and for cones in a supersonic air stream   a second series shows the effects of caloric imperfections on continuous onedimensional flow and on the flow through normal and oblique shock waves
