463  physical properties of plastics for photothermoelastic investigation   tramposch,h and gerard,g  japp mech 25, 1958  physical properties of plastics for photothermoelastic investigation    the optical and physical properties of paraplex p43, castolite, and epoxy resin hysol 6000op, which are potentially of interest in photothermoelastic investigations, were investigated over a temperature range from +100 to 60 f   results on the thermalexpansion coefficient, the material fringe value, and the modulus of elasticity as functions of temperature are presented  also evaluated were thermal properties of importance in heat conduction   photothermoelastic figures of merit, which rate the optical sensitivity of materials in photothermoelastic applications, as well as a new method to determine this figure in a relative manner are presented
