1278  transition in a separated laminar boundary layer   lochtenberg,bh  jaescs1960, 92  transition in a separated laminar boundary layer    transition to turbulence was studied in a separated laminar boundary layer on a flat plate 24 in long and thick   steps with a height of to were provided at a distance of 4 to transition was observed through a hotwire anemometer   the author concludes that transition was always initiated by tollmienschlichting waves   two types of transition were observed   in one type, bursts suddenly appeared in the wavy flow   the other type consists of amplification, distortion, and breaking up of the waves  which type of transition occurs depends on the value of the following parameter   boundarylayer displacement thickness times step height times freestream velocity squared divided by kinematic velocity squared   the burst type has been observed for values of this parameter larger than 42 x 10   the separated laminar boundary layer becomes unstable and develops waves when the critical reynolds  number based on boundarylayer displacement thickness at the step location exceeds a value of 350   some conclusions on the development of separation bubbles on air foils are drawn from the present studies
