700  two and threedimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flight   lomax et al  naca rep 1077, 1952   two and threedimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flight  the problem of transient lift on two and threedimensional wings flying  at high speeds is discussed as a boundaryvalue problem for the classical wave equation  kirchhoffs formula is applied so that the analysis is reduced, just as in the steady state, to an investigation of  sources and doublets  the applications include the evaluation of indicial lift and pitchingmoment curves for twodimensional sinking and pitching wings flying at mach numbers equal to 0, 08, 10, 12, and triangular wings in both forward and reversed flow are presented and compared with the twodimensional values
