172  some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody combination   cortright,em  aero eng rev 15, 1956, 59  some aerodynamic considerations of nozzle afterbody combination    the aerodynamic problems associated with propulsionsystem installations have assumed a role of vital importance in the development of supersonic aircraft   although airinduction systems have received moderate attention in the literature, considerably less information can be found on the design and installation of turbojet exit nozzles   this condition should not be interpreted to indicate a lack of problems in jetexit design    as flight speeds reach supersonic levels, it becomes increasingly difficult to achieve nozzle installations which are efficient over the entire speed range   the difficulties largely stem from the fact that the goals of high jet thrust and low afterbody drag are not always compatible   in many of the compromise solutions, it is generally unsatisfactory to examine isolated nozzle and afterbody performance   rather they must be treated as a unit, and the complex effects of jet interaction with the external stream must be taken into account   to accomplish this, the nozzle and airframe designers must closely coordinate their efforts    some of the aerodynamic problems of nozzle afterbody combinations are outlined in this report  particular attention is devoted to the influence of the jetstream interaction on both nozzle thrust and afterbody drag   for this purpose, use is made of shock boundarylayerinteraction concepts   this approach, although not precise, correctly predicts many trends and is generally enlightening
