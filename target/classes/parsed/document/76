76  flight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations and boundarylayer turbulence   mull,hr and algranti,js  nasa tnd280, 1960  flight measurement of wall pressure fluctuations and boundarylayer turbulence    the results are presented for a flight test program using a fighter type jet aircraft flying at pressure altitudes of 10,000, 20,000, and apparatus was used to measure and record the output of microphones and hotwire anemometers mounted on the forwardfuselage section and wing of the airplane   meanvelocity profiles in the boundary layers were obtained from totalpressure measurements    the ratio of the rootmeansquare fluctuating wall pressure to the freestream dynamic pressure is presented as a function of reynolds number and mach number   the longitudinal component of the turbulentvelocity fluctuations was measured, and the turbulenceintensity profiles are presented for the wing and forwardfuselage section    in general, the results are in agreement with windtunnel measurements which have been reported in the literature   for example, the variation of (is the root mean square of the wallpressure fluctuation, and q is the freestream dynamic pressure) with reynolds number was found to be essentially constant for the forward fuselagesection boundary layer, while variations at the wing station were probably unduly affected by the microphone diameter, which was large compared with the boundarylayer thickness
