973  interaction effects produced by jet exhausting laterally near base of ogivecylinder model in supersonic main stream   vinson, pw, amick, jl and liepman, hp  nasa memo 12558w, february, 1959   interaction effects produced by jet exhausting laterally near base of ogivecylinder model in supersonic main stream  the experimentally determined interaction effects of a side jet exhausting near the base of an ogivecylinder model are presented and discussed  the interaction force appears to be independent of mainstream mach number, boundarylayer condition /laminar or turbulent/, angle of attack, and forebody length  the ratio of interaction force to  jet force is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of the product of jet stagnationtofreestream pressure ratio and jetto body diameter ratio
