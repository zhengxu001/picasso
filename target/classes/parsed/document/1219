1219  determination of lift or drag programs to minimize reentry heating   bryson,ae  j ae scs 1962, 420  determination of lift or drag programs to minimize reentry heating    a study of singlepass reentry from escape speed and from circular satellite speed is made to determine the lift program for a hypersonic glider and the dragmodulation program for a nonlifting vehicle that minimize the heating of the vehicles within acceleration or range constraints   a new method of numerical solution is used, similar to kelley /method of gradients,/ that permits rapid convergence to the optimum lift program starting with an original good estimate   this method avoids the twopoint boundaryvalue problem of the calculusofvariations formulation, and is applicable to any optimumprograming problem   an accelerationtolerance limit is introduced which describes the human pilot capability to withstand acceleration more accurately than a simple acceleration limit
