39  on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface   sinnott,cs  jaescs 26, 1959, 169  on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface    this study of the flow about an airfoil in a nearsonic stream indicates the important factors determining the pressure distribution on the airfoil   analysis of the mach wave pattern suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived from two simplewave flows, one arising from the mach waves reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoil surface slope   the compressive effect of the reflected mach waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil leadingedge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributions for uncambered airfoils, and it is shown how this can be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to give an equivalent simplewave flow over the airfoil    an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good agreement with experiment
