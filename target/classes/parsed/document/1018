1018  note on creep buckling of columns     note on creep buckling of columns    the results of shorttime elevatedtemperature creep tests of objective of obtaining procedures for predicting column lifetime  semiempirical lifetime curves are obtained with the aid of a previously published column creep theory and are used for deriving column curves  the semiempirical lifetime curves are also used to study the effect of varying applied stress and outofstraightness   in the range considered, small variations in outofstraightness are found to be of little practical significance, whereas, small stress variations change the column lifetime considerably   for the range of outofstraightness encountered in the tests, the data can be presented in plots that do not explicitly include outofstraightness, and plots of this type should be satisfactory for predicting column lifetime for design purposes
