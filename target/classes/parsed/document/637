637  an integral equation relating the general timedependent lift and downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow   joseph a drischler  national aeronautics and space administration technical note d1521  an integral equation relating the general timedependent lift and downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow  an integral equation for obtaining the unsteady air forces on finite wings in subsonic compressible flow is presented   this equation is applicable for any arbitrary timedependent motion and can be utilized for flexible as well as rigid wings   the approach involves the derivation of an integral equation relating the unknown pressure the form of the equation is such that it should lend itself readily to modern highspeed computers for obtaining pressure distributions  special cases of the integral equation are treated for twodimensional incompressible flow and are presented in an appendix
