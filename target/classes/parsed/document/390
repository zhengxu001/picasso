390  some panelflutter studies using piston theory   johns,dj  j ae scs 25, 1958  some panelflutter studies using piston theory    the use of piston theory was recently advocated for supersonic aeroelastic analyses, including the problem of panel flutter, and this has stimulated the investigation reported here    linear piston theory is mainly considered, but some effects of introducing higher order terms are discussed    flutter of rectangular simply supported panels and of elliptically shaped clampededge panels is considered, and some justification is provided for the use of /static/ aerodynamic forces and the neglect of aerodynamic damping   hence, it is concluded that ackeret loading gives more exact results than piston theory    solution of the flutter equations is made by applying galerkin method to a rayleightype analysis using assumed modes of deformation
