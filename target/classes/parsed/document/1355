1355  boundary layer displacement effects in air at mach numbers of 6 8 and 9 6  bertram,mh  nasa trr22, 1959  boundary layer displacement effects in air at mach numbers of 6 8 and 9 6   measurements are presented for pressure gradients induced by a laminar boundary layer on a flat plate in air at a mach number of 96 and for the drag of thin wings at a mach number of about 68 and zero angle of attack   the pressure measurements at a mach number of 96 were made in the presence of substantial heat transfer from the boundary layer to the plate surface   the measured pressure distribution on the surface of the plate was predicted with good accuracy by a modification to insulatedplate displacement theory which allows for the effect of the heat transfer and temperature gradient along the surface on the boundarylayer displacement thickness    the total drag of thin wings with square and delta plan forms was measured at a nominal mach number of 68 over a reasonably wide range of reynolds numbers   the total drag was found to be greater than can be explained by adding a classical value of laminar skin friction to the estimated pressure drag  the difference is, in general, explained by the increase in skin friction (20 to 40 percent) caused by the boundarylayerinduced pressures
