474  laminar mixing of a compressible fluid   dean r chapman   laminar mixing of a compressible fluid  a theoretical investigation of the velocity profiles for laminar mixing of a highvelocity stream with a region of fluid at rest has been made assuming that the prandtl number is unity   a method which involves only quadratures is presented for calculating the velocity profile in the mixing layer for an arbitrary value of the freestream mach number  detailed velocity profiles have been calculated for freestream mach numbers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5   for each mach number, velocity profiles are presented for both a linear and a 076power variation of viscosity with absolute temperature   the calculations for a linear variation are much simpler than those for a 076power variation   it is shown that by selecting the constant of proportionality in the linear approximation such that it gives the correct value for the viscosity in the hightemperature part of the mixing layer, the resulting velocity profiles are in excellent agreement with those calculated by a 076power variation
