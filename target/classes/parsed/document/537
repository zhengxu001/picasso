537  stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow   stoddard,fj  j ae scs 29, 1962, 1138  stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow  several methods have been developed for computing the hypersonic, low reynolds number flow in the stagnation region of a blunt body   in general, these methods involve complicated numerical solutions   simultaneous iterations on several parameters are usually required in view of the boundaryvalue nature of the problem    the purpose of this note is to present an approximate closedform solution to axisymmetric stagnation point hypersonic flow in the viscous layer regime
