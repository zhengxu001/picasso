88  magnetohydrodynamic freeconvection pipe flow   cramer,kr  j ae scs 28, 1961, 736  magnetohydrodynamic freeconvection pipe flow  it has been shown that transverse magnetic fields of practical strengths exert considerable influence on liquidmetal, freeconvection, vertical, flatplate and parallelplate flow fields  the extent of influence was determined by the magnitude of a nondimensional parameter a which is the ratio of the hartmann number to the fourth root of the grashof number, and is a measure of the relative influence of the magnetic and buoyant forces   in this note the steady, fully developed, laminar, freeconvection flow of a fluid of electrical conductivity through a fully submerged, openended, constanttemperature, vertical pipe located in a transverse magnetic field of strength is analyzed in terms of the same parameter   the magnitude of its influence on the velocity and temperature profiles, the surface shear and heat transfer, and the volumetric flow rate is determined
