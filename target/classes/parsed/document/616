616  determination of upperatmosphere air density and scale height from satellite observations   groves, gv  proc roy soc a 252, 1627, 1959   determination of upperatmosphere air density and scale height from satellite observations  a solution is obtained for the rate of change of semimajor axis and perigee distance of a satellite orbit with time due to the resistance of  the atmosphere  the logarithm of air density is assumed to vary quadratically with height, and the oblateness of the atmosphere is taken into account  the calculation of perigee air density in terms of the rate of change of satellite period is dealt with, and the method is applied to data at present available on six different satellites  the variation of air density with height is obtained as in p2859/015/h200//46/5/0028/0013//h200///46/ for h in the range of approximately 170 to 700 km, where p is in grams/c m, h is in kilometres and standard deviations are given in brackets
