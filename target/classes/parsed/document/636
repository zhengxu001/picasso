636  pressure distribution induced on a flat plate at a freestream mach number of 139 by rockets exhausting upstream and downstream   abraham leiss  national aeronautics and space administration technical note d1507  pressure distribution induced on a flat plate at a freestream mach number of 139 by rockets exhausting upstream and downstream  an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on a flat plate at a freestream mach number of 139 by a supersonic rocket jet exhausting upstream and downstream   measurements of the pressure distribution on a flat plate were made at zero angle of attack for 11 different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneath the wing   measurements were made at ratios of rocketexit total pressure to freestream static pressure from 6 to 60 and at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 10 times 10 to the power of 6   the rocket when exhausted upstream produced a strong shock that moved further upstream with increasing rocketexit totalpressure ratio  positive incremental normalforce coefficients were obtained at all test positions   data at 11 test positions are tabulated for rocketon and rocketoff pressure coefficients as well as for incremental pressure coefficients for the 48 orifices of the flat plate for the range of ratio of rocketexit total pressure to freestream static pressure of the investigation   changing the location of the model with respect to the plate had a negligible effect when the rocket was varied in the chordwise direction, but the pressure coefficients were reduced as the rocket was lowered away from the flatplate wing
