1297  ionization nonequilibrium in expanding flows   eschenroeder,aq  ars jnl 1962, 32  ionization nonequilibrium in expanding flows    approximate methods are developed for solving the electronion kinetic equations in expanding quasi onedimensional airflows   results are obtained for inviscid nozzle flows at conditions appropriate to shock tunnel testing and are compared with exact numerical solutions   effects on rf transmission and dc conductivity are examined  since twobody deionization never fully freezes in the flows considered here, the assumption of sudden freezing gives an upper bound on the residual ionization at large area ratios   the use of an asymptotic form of solution with the freezing criterion provides an improved estimate for such cases  ionization nonequilibrium is also considered for the plasma sheath associated with blunt hypersonic bodies flying at high altitudes  the influence of atomic ions is examined for typical reentry conditions
