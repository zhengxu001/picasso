1050  compressive buckling of simply supported curved plates and cylinders of sandwich construction   stein,m and mayers,j  naca tn2601, 1952  compressive buckling of simply supported curved plates and cylinders of sandwich construction    theoretical solutions are presented for the buckling in uniform axial compression of two types of simply supported curved sandwich plates   the corrugatedcore type and the isotropiccore type   the solutions are obtained from a theory for orthotropic curved plates in which deflections due to shear are taken into account   results are given in the form of equations and curves
