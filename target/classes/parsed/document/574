574  inviscid flow with nonequilibrium molecular dissociation for pressure distributions encountered in hypersonic flight   bloom, mg and steiger, mh  j aero sc v 27, pp 821835, 1960   inviscid flow with nonequilibrium molecular dissociation for pressure distributions encountered in hypersonic flight  onedimensional inviscid nonequilibrium flows of a twocomponent model gas are studied for prescribed pressure variations and an average reaction rate based on recent data for oxygen recombination  these flows are interpreted in relation to the flow along streamlines around blunt hypersonic bodies  assuming equilibrium conditions in the subsonic region, it is estimated that the flow in the initial supersonic expansion region, which is approximately of prandtlmeyer character, will be chemically frozen with respect to the molecular dissociation of the primary components under the hypersonic, highaltitude flight conditions  considered  the flight conditions consist of flight velocities between furthermore, on bodies of small surface inclination beyond the nose, the  flow will continue to be effectively frozen for at least 20 ft downstream of the nose  these conclusions may lead to the simplification of  procedures for theoretical calculation and testing  the problem of distinguishing a dimensionless lengthreaction rate parameter, which characterizes the extent of departures from equilibrium or  from frozen behavior in the flow fields of interest here, is discussed
