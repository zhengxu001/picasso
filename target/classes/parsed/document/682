682  the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flow   lance, gn  aero quart v 6/2/, may, 1955   the lift of twisted and cambered wings in supersonic flow  a generalised conical flow theory is used to deduce an integral equation  relating the velocity potential on a delta wing/with subsonic leading edges/to the given downwash distribution over the wing  the complete solution of this integral equation is derived  this complete solution is composed of two parts, one being symmetric and the other antisymmetric with respect to the spanwise coordinate, each part represents a velocity potential  for example, if y is the spanwise coordinate and x is measured in the free stream direction, then a downwash of the form wa ux/y/is symmetric and will give rise to a symmetric potential, whereas wa ux/y/sgn y is antisymmetric and gives rise to an antisymmetric potential  the velocity potentials of such flows are given in the form of tables for all downwashes up to and including homogenous cubics in the spanwise and streamwise coordinates  table iii gives similar formulae in the limiting case were used over a cycle of the tumbling motion  the analytical expression was in good agreement with numerical solutions of the complete nonlinear equations of motion
