20  generalisednewtonian theory   love,es  j ae scs 26, 1959, 314  generalisednewtonian theory    author generalizes lees (amr 10(1957), rev 2601) modification of newtonian theory for bluntnose bodies to apply to pointed nose bodies as well   the result is expressed by sin where is the local inclination of the body surface and the subscript /max/ refers to the maximum local inclination and pressure coefficient   for bluntnose bodies and the generalized theory reverts to lees bluntnose modification with given by normal shock relations   author shows, by comparison of newtonian and generalizednewtonian theory with exact solutions, the superiority of generalizednewtonian theory   he also shows that both twodimensional and axisymmetric shapes are correlated by this generalization   results are presented in two figures that support author generalization and indicate the independence of the correlation from variations in both the hypersonic similarity parameter k = m(d1) and the ratio of specific heats y    reviewer believes this generalization should be of interest to those engaged in development of hypersonic hardware as well as theory
