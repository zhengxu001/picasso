1202  uniformly valid secondorder solution for supersonic flow over cruciform surfaces   wallace,j and clarke,jh  aiaa jnl 1, 1963, 179  uniformly valid secondorder solution for supersonic flow over cruciform surfaces    considered is the secondorder supersonic flow over a cruciform configuration consisting of two intersecting rectangular wings of high aspect ratio   the practical interest is in application to supersonic inlets, wingbody junctions and vehicle fins  the fundamental interest centers about identification and adjustment of the severe local failures of the ordinary secondorder theory   for wings with discontinuous slopes, discontinuous potentials occur across the planar shock and squareroot singularities in the velocities occur at the intersection of these shocks with the cruciform surfaces   the problem is simple enough so that these interesting features stand out clearly    a secondorder solution uniformly valid to first order is constructed by adjustment of the ordinary secondorder solution obtained first   the uniformly valid solution has two different series representations in the thickness parameter   one is the ordinary secondorder series in ascending integral powers of the thickness parameter which is valid in the interior of the vertexcentered undisturbed mach cone, and the other is a series containing fractional powers which is valid adjacent to and upstream of this mach cone   the uniformly valid solution gives the detailed wave structure and shows a flow regime upstream of the vertexcentered undisturbed mach cone not predicted by the ordinary theory   the two solutions are otherwise identical  the wave structure consists of a pyramidal arrangement of planar shocks adjacent to and upstream of the above cone, followed by weaker oblique expansion fans and finally by two extremely weak shocks coincident with the vertexcentered undisturbed mach cone   as an example of the above, detailed results are presented for the case of two intersecting wedges   application of the techniques to other quasicylindrical problems is discussed
