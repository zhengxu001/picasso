508  a correlation of nosebluntness induced pressures on cylindrical and conical afterbodies at hypersonic speeds   greenberg,ra  j ae scs 29, 1962, 359  a correlation of nosebluntness induced pressures on cylindrical and conical afterbodies at hypersonic speeds  van hise, in his detailed study of the nosebluntnessinduced pressures on cylindrical afterbodies, shows that, starting a few nose diameters aft of the noseafterbody junction, these pressures are correlated with the parameter as predicted by the blastwave analogy   chernyi developed a modified form of the blastwave analogy which takes into account the addition of energy to the flow by a thin afterbody   he showed that for thin afterbodies and hypersonic speeds, the pressure distribution, plotted as should correlate with the parameter   the purpose of this note is to show that the above correlation techniques may be combined into a form such that pressures on cylindrical and conical afterbodies are correlated by one parameter
