173  the effect of a central jet on the base pressure of a cylindrical afterbody in a supersonic stream   reid,j and hastings,rc  arc r + m3224, 1962  the effect of a central jet on the base pressure of a cylindrical afterbody in a supersonic stream    this report describes an experimental investigation of the factors affecting the base flow and jet structure behind a cylindrical afterbody with a central nozzle  seven interchangeable nozzles were tested  six of these were convergentdivergent, with a design mach number of 20, jet base diameter ratios ranging from 02 to 08 and nozzle divergence angles ranging from convergent with a jet base diameter ratio of 06    in the main experimental programme the freestream mach number was 20 and the boundary layer was turbulent both on the afterbody and in the nozzle  measurements were made of the base pressure, the surface pressure distribution inside the nozzle, the overall thrust and the nozzle mass flow, over a range of jet pressures  this programme was supplemented by comparative tests with the jet exhausting into still air (static tests)  readings were taken of the internal nozzle pressures and the jet thrust at different jet pressures   schlieren photography was used extensively throughout    the results of the tests with external flow are presented in the form of curves showing the separate effects of jet pressure ratio, jet base diameter ratio, nozzle design mach number and nozzle divergence angle on the base pressure and overall thrust   the special case of base bleed is discussed separately   similar curves are included for the static tests   these show the effect of jet pressure ratio and nozzle geometry on the jet thrust    a general method of correlating data on annular base pressures is proposed and discussed   essentially, this method compares the pressure on an annular base with the calculated pressure on the corresponding twodimensional base   it correlates the present results reasonably well, but is less successful when applied to more extensive data
