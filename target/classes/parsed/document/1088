1088  iterative methods for solving partial difference equations of elliptic type   young, d  trans amer math soc vol 76, p 92, 1954   iterative methods for solving partial difference equations of elliptic type  this paper considers linear systems /1/ where a includes matrices of a sort frequently occurring in the solution of elliptic partial differential equations by difference methods /in particular, a o/  rewriting  superscript is number of iteration cycle/ are used to compute u when u are used  also, one may /overrelax/  ser a 210, 307357 /1910/ who suggested changing from time to time to speed up convergence  in the present paper overrelaxation /with fixed w/ is combined with immediate introduction of newlycomputed u, a la gaussseidel  various theorems on convergence are proved$ in particular, it is shown that there exists an ordering of the equations and an optimum value wb such that in general /3/ converges much more rapidly than the gaussseidel method /w 1/  means are suggested for estimating wb, the sensitivity of the rate of convergence to the choice  of w is studied  the paper concludes with a theoretical comparison of gaussseidel and the method proposed, /successive overrelaxation/, for solving dirichlet difference problem over a square using a highspeed computing machine
