141  freeflight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research   hamilton,ja and hufton,pa  jroyaes 60, 1956, 151  freeflight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research    the development rocketborne and rocketlaunched highspeed airplane model test is described   details of airborne components, telemetering units, tracking, and their calibration are also discussed  tests on controls, drag measurements, longitudinal stability evaluations, lift measurements, pressure measurements, aeroelastic estimations, and sonic bang recordings are effected   the reynolds numbers involved are much higher than are usual in the wind tunnel, and extensions of mach numbers are obtained beyond the tunnel limits, both free of the tunnel wall interference
