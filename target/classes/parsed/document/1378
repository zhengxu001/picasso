1378  bluntcone pressure distributions at hypersonic mach numbers   andrew f burke and james t curtis  head, research section, and research aerodynamicist, respectively, applied hypersonic research dept, cornell aeronautical laboratory, inc, buffalo, ny  bluntcone pressure distributions at hypersonic mach numbers  the static pressure distributions on the surface of a blunted 75 degreehalfangle cone have recently been experimentally determined in the cal 48 inch hypersonic shock tunnel   this facility and the associated instrumentation are described in detail in ref 1   these tests covered a mach number range of 8 to 18 at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 1 times 10 to the 5th power, the models included one flatfaced cone and two hemispherically blunted cones
