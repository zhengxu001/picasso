126  an investigation of twodimensional supersonic base pressures   charwat,af and yakura,jk  jaeroscs 25, 1958, 122  an investigation of twodimensional supersonic base pressures    an investigation of the base pressure behind wedges at mach numbers 2 and 3 in the laminar and the transitional regime is reported   temperature and velocity traverses through the mixing zone are shown and exploratory investigations of the wake vortex by use of hot wires and flowvisualization techniques are described   it is found that the laminar twodimensional base pressure agrees well with chapman theoretical predictions  the shear layer exhibits gross velocity distributions characteristic of the free jet mixing zone, but also shows disturbances that originate in the expansionturning of the oncoming boundary layer   an interesting trailing vortex is observed, which is explained in terms of nonuniform mixing rate in the wake
