1326  interaction of secondary injectants and rocket exhaust for thrust vector control   newton,jf and spaid,fw  ars jnl 32, 1962, 1203  interaction of secondary injectants and rocket exhaust for thrust vector control    tests were conducted with 1300 to 1500lb thrust solid rocket motors in order to investigate the sideforce generation mechanisms associated with the injection of a secondary fluid into the expansion cone of a solid propellant rocket nozzle for thrustvector control   the nozzles were 15 conicals with a nominal expansion ratio of   all firings were conducted in zeroflow ejectors  freon12, water, and gascous nitrogen were used as the injectant   nozzlewall pressure profiles, side thrust, and the nozzlewall shock interface were recorded   the general character of the pressure disturbance was defined   the major portion of the side force was generated by the pressure disturbance downstream of the injector   the axialthrust augmentation generated by the injectant was calculated   the effects of nozzleexpansion ratio and injector location on the side force were clearly illustrated
