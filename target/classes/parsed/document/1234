1234  direct calculation of pressure distribution on blunt hypersonic nose shapes with sharp corners   holt,m  j ae scs 1961, 872  direct calculation of pressure distribution on blunt hypersonic nose shapes with sharp corners    the method of belotserkovskii for calculating hypersonic flow fields past a circular cylinder is extended to deal with axiallysymmetric flow past sharpcornered nose shapes, in particular, spherical segments and flatheaded cylinders   results on spheres are also included   in the present paper belotserkovskii first approximation is considered, and comparison of calculated pressure distribution and shock shape with experimental results shows very good agreement
