1076  an approximate method for determining the displacement effects and viscous drag of laminar boundary layers in twodimensional hypersonic flow   bertram, mh  naca tn 2773, 1952   an approximate method for determining the displacement effects and viscous drag of laminar boundary layers in twodimensional hypersonic flow  a simplified approximate theory is presented by means of which the laminar boundary layer over an insulated twodimensional surface may be calculated, a linear velocity profile being assumed, and an estimate made of its effect in changing the pressure distribution over the profile upon which the boundary layer is formed  skin friction is also determined  comparisons of results from this theory are made with experimental results at a mach number of 686 and a reynolds number of
