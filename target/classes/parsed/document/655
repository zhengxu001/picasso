655  effects of boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness on pressure distribution, skin friction, and heat transfer of bodies at hypersonic speeds   bertram, mh and henderson, a  naca tn 4301, july 1958   effects of boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness on pressure distribution, skin friction, and heat transfer of bodies at hypersonic speeds  results are presented of an investigation to determine the effect of boundarylayer displacement and leadingedge bluntness on surfaces in hypersonic flow  the presence of the boundary layer and the blunt leading edge induce pressure gradients which in turn affect the skin friction and heat transfer to the surface  methods for predicting these  phenomena on twodimensional surfaces are given and a brief review of recent threedimensional results is presented
