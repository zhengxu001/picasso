758  the lower bound of attainable sonicboom overpressure and design methods of approaching this limit   carlson,hw  nasa tnd1494, 1962  the lower bound of attainable sonicboom overpressure and design methods of approaching this limit    from a study of existing sonicboom theory it has been possible to establish an approximate lower bound of attainable sonicboom overpressure, which depends only on the airplane length, weight, and volume and on the flight conditions  this lower bound may be approached over a narrow range of flight conditions through the application of appropriate design considerations   in general, for intermediate values of lift coefficient the major portion of the lift generating surfaces must be located aft of the maximum crosssectional area, whereas for higher values of lift coefficient the maximum area must be well forward and or the liftproducing surfaces must extend well toward the airplane nose
