495  on similar solutions for strong blast waves and their application to steady hypersonic flow   borcher,ef  j ae scs 29, 1962, 694  on similar solutions for strong blast waves and their application to steady hypersonic flow    the general solution of the strong blast wave is found in the newtonian approximationie, neglecting terms of order the expressions obtained for the pressure, temperature, density, and velocity profiles are simple   the results are applied to powerlaw bodies in hypersonic flow using the equivalence principle    higherorder approximations for strong blast waves are investigated for the cases in which the shock layer is thin   a simple pressure formula is found, which constitutes an improvement upon the newtonbusemann formula, and some of its applications are shown
