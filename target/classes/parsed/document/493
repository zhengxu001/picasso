493  realgas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heat transfer   wilson,re  j ae scs 29, 1962, 640  realgas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heat transfer    the laminarboundarylayer equations have been integrated for the case of a flat plate over a wide range of freestream enthalpies and velocities and over a wide range of enthalpies of the gas at the wall   the range of freestream velocities extended up to 25,000 ft sec at low freestream enthalpies, corresponding to local conditions on a slender body traveling at high speeds  at low freestream velocities, the range of freestream enthalpies extended up to 400,000 btu slug, corresponding to the local conditions on a blunt body traveling at speeds up to 25,000 ft sec  the gas was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at each point in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected  the solutions to the boundarylayer equations were carried out on a highspeed digital computing machine, both skinfriction and heattransfer coefficients being obtained from the computations    before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin and johnson for computing skinfriction coefficients for the perfectgas case is reviewed   for the realgas case, the average temperature, t', is replaced by the average enthalpy, h', and the h' method is then used to compute skinfriction coefficients   these values are in excellent agreement with the computingmachine results   it was found that the recovery factor for the realgas case can be approximated by, the best results for the cases considered being obtained if a value of pr corresponding to the enthalpy, h', is used   using this recovery factor and reynolds analogy, heattransfer rates can be computed which, with a few exceptions, are within 5 percent of values obtained from computingmachine results
