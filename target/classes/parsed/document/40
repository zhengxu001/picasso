40  experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds   van driest,er and boison,jc  j ae scs 24, 1957, 885  experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds    tests were conducted in the 12in continuous supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of technology, to determine the effects of surface cooling on boundarylayer transition at supersonic speeds   the effects of cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 197, smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supplystream turbulence (04, 2, and 9 per cent) and several singleelement roughnesses at fixed axial location   transition data were obtained optically by means of a magnifiedschlieren system   the results, for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1) transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supplystream turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and roughness decrease with increasing mach number
