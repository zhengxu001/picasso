911  experimental study of the random vibrations of an aircraft structure excited by jet noise   clarkson,bl and ford,rd  usaa r128, univ of southampton, 1960  experimental study of the random vibrations of an aircraft structure excited by jet noise    recordings have been made of the strains induced in a full scale rear fuselage test structure of the caravelle airliner when one jet engine is running at maximum takeoff thrust   the analysis has been concentrated on the strains in the centres of panels   correlation measurements indicate that the larger panel strains occur above resonance peak in each panel has been identified with the fundamental stringertwisting mode but the modeshapes for the two smaller peaks have not been completely determined  an attempt has been made to calculate the panel resonant frequencies theoretically
