752  slender notsothin wing theory   cooke,jc  rae raero2660, 1962  slender notsothin wing theory    a method for making an approximate thickness correction to slender thinwing theory is presented   the method is tested by applying it to cones with rhombic crosssections and the agreement is found to be good if the cones are not too thick   it is then suggested that the thickness correction to slender thinwing theory may be applied unchanged to linear thinwing theory   this suggestion is compared with some experiments on delta wings and it is found that there is considerable improvement over thinwing theory near the centre line, but that this improvement is not maintained as the wing tips are approached
