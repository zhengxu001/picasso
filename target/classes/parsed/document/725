725  the response of a typical aircraft structure to jet noise   clarkson,bl and ford,rd  j roy aero soc 1962  the response of a typical aircraft structure to jet noise    an analysis is made of experimentally determined mode shapes excited on the rear structure of a modern airliner by jet noise from a podmounted turbojet engine   power spectra of stresses determined from straingage measurements are obtained and cross correlated   extensive measurements were made on skin panels of the fuselage and elevator and limited ones were made on fuselage stringers and frames   the skinpanel results are compared with theoretical predictions   reviewer believes that this paper is of considerable value for those concerned with response of aircrafttype structures to jetinduced noise
