563  the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer   coles,d  j fluid mech 1, 1956,191  the law of the wake in the turbulent boundary layer    after an extensive survey of meanvelocity profile measurements in various twodimensional incompressible turbulent boundarylayer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear combination of two universal functions   one is the wellknown law of the wall   the other, called the law of the wake, is characterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment  these functions are considered to be established empirically, by a study of the meanvelocity profile, without reference to any hypothetical mechanism of turbulence   using the resulting complete analytic representation for the meanvelocity field, the shearingstress field for several flows is computed from the boundarylayer equations and compared with experimental data    the development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly represents the largeeddy structure and is a consequence of the constraint provided by inertia   this equivalent wake profile is modified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is provided by viscosity   the wall constraint, although it penetrates the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow and in the logarithmic profile near the wall    finally, it is suggested that yawed or threedimensional flows may be usefully represented by the same two universal functions, considered as vector rather than scalar quantities   if the wall component is defined to be in the direction of the surface shearing stress, then the wake component, at least in the few cases studied, is found to be very nearly parallel to the gradient of the pressure
