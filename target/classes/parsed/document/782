782  calculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives of unswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll   queiijo, mj and riley, dr  naca, tn 3245, 1954   calculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives of unswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll  subsonic span loads and the resulting stability derivatives have been calculated for a systematic series of vertical and horizontaltail combinations in sideslip and in steady roll in order to provide information embracing a wide range of probable tail configurations  all  calculations were made by application of the discretehorseshoevortex method to the problem of estimating loads on intersecting surfaces  the  investigation covered variations in verticaltail aspect ratio, the ratio of horizontaltail aspect ratio to verticaltail aspect ratio, the  effects of horizontaltail dihedral angle /for the sideslip case/, and the effects of vertical position of the horizontal tail for surfaces having their quarterchord lines swept back 0degrees and 45degrees  the  results of the investigation are presented in charts from which the span loads for the various conditions can be obtained  the resulting stability derivatives are presented as vertical and horizontaltail contributions as well as totaltailassembly derivatives  the results of this investigation, which was made for a wider range of geometric variables than previous studies, showed trends which were in general agreement with the results of previous investigations  also presented in this paper and used in the computations is an extensive table of values of sidewash due to a rectangular vortex
