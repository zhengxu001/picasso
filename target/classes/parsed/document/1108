1108  a study of secondorder supersonic flow theory   vandyke,md  naca r1071, 1952  a study of secondorder supersonic flow theory    an attempt is made to develop a second approximation to the solution of problems of supersonic flow which can be solved by existing firstorder theory   the method of attack adopted is an iteration process using the linearized solution as the first step    for plane flow it is found that a particular integral of the iteration equation can be written down at once in terms of the firstorder solution   the secondorder problem is thereby reduced to an equivalent firstorder problem and can be readily solved   at the surface of an isolated body, the solution reduces to the wellknown result of busemann   the plane case is considered in some detail insofar as it gives insight into the nature of the iteration process    again, for axially symmetric flow the problem is reduced to a firstorder problem by the discovery of a particular integral  for smooth bodies, the secondorder solution can then be calculated by the method of von karman and moore   bodies with corners are also treated by a slight modification of the method   the secondorder solution for cones represents a considerable improvement over the linearized result  secondorder theory also agrees well with several solutions for other bodies of revolution calculated by the numerical method of characteristics    for full threedimensional flow, only a partial particular integral has been found   as an example of a more general problem, the solution is derived for an inclined cone   the possibility of treating other inclined bodies of revolution and threedimensional wings is discussed briefly
