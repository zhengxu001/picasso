1318  stagnation temperature measurements in a hypersonic gun tunnel using the  sodiumline reversal method   stollery, jl  arc 22854, may 1961   stagnation temperature measurements in a hypersonic gun tunnel using the  sodiumline reversal method  the sodium line reversal /slr/ method has recently been used to measure transient temperatures in the 1400degreek to 3000degreek range, for  example ref6 reports measurements of gun flash temperatures  in the gun tunnel, stagnation temperatures in the above range can be generated flow between a blunt body and its bow shock wave  the gas temperature in this zone is close to the stagnation value
