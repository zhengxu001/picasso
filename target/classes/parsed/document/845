845  the flexural vibrations of thin cylinders   arnold,rn and warburton,gb  j proc i mech e 167, 1953, 62  the flexural vibrations of thin cylinders  the flexural vibrations of the walls of thin cylinders are considered  in this type of vibration many forms of nodal pattern may exist owing to the combination of circumferential and axial nodes   theoretical expressions are developed for the natural frequencies of cylinders with freelysupported and fixed ends and a comparison is made with the frequencies obtained experimentally    in practice, the ends of cylinders are subjected to a certain degree of fixing by endplates, flanges, etc, and the natural frequencies thus lie between the corresponding values for freelysupported and fixed ends   to make possible the estimation of such frequencies, a method is devised in which an equivalent wavelength factor is used   this factor represents the wavelength of the freelysupported cylinder that would have the same frequency as the cylinder under consideration when vibrating in the same mode   the results of experimental investigations with various end thicknesses and flange dimensions are recorded, and from these the equivalent factors are derived    sets of curves calculated for cylinders with freelysupported ends and covering a range of cylinder thicknesses are given   from these it is possible to obtain close approximation to the frequencies of cylinders under other end conditions by the use of an appropriate factor   an example is given of frequency calculations for a large airreceiver for which two frequencies were identified by experiment
