1092  wingnacellepropeller interference for wings of various spans  force and pressure distribution tests   robinson,rg and herrnstein,wh  naca r569, 1936  wingnacellepropeller interference for wings of various spans  force and pressure distribution tests    an experimental investigation was made in the n a c a fullscale wind tunnel to determine the effect of wing span on nacellepropeller characteristics and, reciprocally, the lateral extent of nacelle and propeller influence on a monoplane wing   the results provide a check on the validity of the previous research on nacelles and propellers with 15footspan wings tested in the   the scale propeller and the n a c a cowling used in the former researches were tested in three typical tractor locations with respect to a thick wing of 5foot chord and 30foot span   the span was progressively reduced to 25,20, and 15 feet and the same characteristics were measured in each case    the efficiency factorspropulsive efficiency, nacelle drag efficiency, and net efficiencywere obtained for each wing length by means of force tests and the values are compared to determine the effect of span  pressuredistribution measurements show the lateral extent of the nacelle interference and the propellerslipstream effect on the span loading for the various conditions   complete polar curves and curves showing the variation of nacelle drag with lift coefficient are also included    force and pressuredistribution tests concur in indicating that, for engineering purposes, the influence of a nacelle and of a propeller, in a usual combination, may be considered to extend laterally on a wing the same maximum distance, or about five nacelle diameters or two propeller diameters outboard of their common axes   all important effects of scale nacellepropeller combinations may be measured within practical limits of accuracy by tests of a 15footspan wing
