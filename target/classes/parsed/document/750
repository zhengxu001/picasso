750  transonic flow in two dimensional and axially symmetrical nozzles   hall,im  arc 23,347, 1961  transonic flow in two dimensional and axially symmetrical nozzles    by means of suitable expansions in inverse powers of r, the radius of curvature of the nozzle profile at the throat measured in throat halfheights, the velocity components in the throat region of a convergentdivergent nozzle can be calculated   the first three terms of the series solution have been obtained both for twodimensional and for axiallysymmetric nozzles   the numerical accuracy of the solution is confirmed by comparison with the known exact solution along the branchline
