91  periodic temperature distribution in a twolayer composite slab   w f campbell  national aeronautical establishment, ottawa, ont, canada  periodic temperature distribution in a twolayer composite slab  in a recent contribution to the reader forum, under the above title, stonecypher outlined a method for finding the periodic temperature distribution in a twolayer composite slab, one exposed surface of the slab being insulated and the other subject to a sinusoidal temperature variation   perfect thermal contact between the two layers, and constant thermal properties were assumed  two years ago i drew attention in these pages to a method for determining the transient temperature in such a twolayer slab resulting from a triangular heatinput pulse   i should like to point out that this same method also is applicable to the case where one external face is given a sinusoidal temperature variation with time   the method is based on the analogy between onedimensional heat flow and the flow of an electric current in a simple transmission line having only series resistance and parallel capacitance
