94  the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary layer flow   probstein,rf and elliott,d  j aescs 28, 1956, 206  the transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundary layer flow    the viscous transverse curvature effect in compressible axially symmetric laminar boundarylayer flow has been investigated, and it is found that the effect is characterized by the parameter which is essentially the ratio of the boundarylayer thickness to body radius   it is shown that the busemann and crocco integrals of the twodimensional energy equation for are still valid for axially symmetric flow in which the transverse curvature effects are considered   by a generalization of mangler transformation it is then shown that the boundarylayer equations are reducible to an almost twodimensional form, making the analysis simpler for two asymptotic flow regions characterized by and less than or of the order of unity  it is with the latter region that the present paper is primarily concerned, and for this case it is shown that the additional term in the momentum and energy equations, which differentiates them from the twodimensional form, behaves like an external favorable pressure gradient    except for certain special cases it is necessary to obtain the of the order of unity by means of asymptotic expansions in ascending powers of a parameter that is small compared to unity but proportional to   it is shown how the asymptotic solutions can be found for (1) the velocity and temperature distributions for the compressible zero pressure gradient case when the body shapes are given by and and (2) the velocity distribution for incompressible flow with an external velocity of the form past a body given by   the zeroth approximation is the mangler result   for the cases of a linear external velocity distribution, similar profiles can be found for all values of   more generally it is shown that similar profiles exist if the exponents n and m satisfy the condition that  here, similar is used in the restricted meaning that the distributions are derivable from ordinary differential equations    in the case of the cone and cylinder with zero pressure gradient where the equations have been numerically integrated for, the firstorder correction to the mangler formulation shows that the effect on both the skinfriction coefficient and heattransfer rate can become appreciable in the range where is less than or of the order of unity   at a constant, the effects are increased in magnitude when either the ratio of wall to freestream temperature, or mach number, is increased   also, all other conditions being equal, for the same value of the skinfriction coefficient and heattransfer increase on the cylinder is greater than that on the cone    for flows with pressure gradient, the transverse curvature term behaves again like a favorable pressure gradient and tends to delay both separation and transition when compared with axially symmetric flows in which the transverse curvature effect is neglected
