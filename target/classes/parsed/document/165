165  skinfriction measurements in incompressible flow   smith, dw and  walker, j h  naca report r26  skinfriction measurements in incompressible flow  experiments have been conducted to measure in incompressible flow the local surfaceshear stress and the average skinfriction coefficient for a turbulent boundarylayer on a smooth flat plate having zero pressure gradient  the local surfaceshear stress was measured by a floatingelement skinfriction balance and also by a calibrated total head tube located on the surface of the test wall  the average skinfriction coefficient was obtained from boundarylayer velocity profiles  the boundarylayer profiles were also used to determine the location of the virtual origin of the turbulent boundary layer  data were obtainec for a range of reynolds numbers from 1 million to about 45 million with an attendant change in mach number from 011 to 032     the measured local skinfriction coefficients obtained with the floatingelement balance agree well with those of schultzgrunow and kempf for reynolds numbers up to 45 million  the measured average skinfriction coefficients agree with those given by the schoenherr curve in the ranges of reynolds numbers from 1 to 3 million and 30 to 45 million  in the range of reynolds numbers from 3 to 30 million the measured values are less than those predicted by the schoenherr        curve  the results show that the /univeral skinfriction constants/ proposed by coles appraoch asymptotically a constant value at reynolds numbers exceeding mentioned constants and the limited reynolds number range of the present investigation, there is some doubt as to the validity of any turbulent skinfriction law written on the basis of the present results  hence, no new friction law is proposed     the frictional resistance of a flat plate was calculated by means of the momentum method and also the integrated measured local surface shear  for reynolds numbers from 14 million to 45 million both methods give about the same result, whereas at lower values of reynolds number the momentum method based on velocity profiles uncorrected for the effects of turbulence results in a frictional resistance as much as 4 percent higher than that of the integrated shear  the measurement of local surface shear by a calibrated preston tube appears to be accurate and inexpensive  the calibration as given by preston must be modified slighlty, however, to yield the results obtained from the floatingelement skinfriction balance
