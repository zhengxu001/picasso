801  experimental study of the equivalence of transonic flow about slender conecylinders of circular and elliptic cross section   page,wa  naca tn4233, 1958  experimental study of the equivalence of transonic flow about slender conecylinders of circular and elliptic cross section    this report describes an experimental investigation of the equivalence relationship and the related theory for lifting forces proposed by transonic slenderbody theory   the models chosen for this study are a flat, winglike, elliptic conecylinder and its equivalent body of revolution, a circular conecylinder   it is determined that the flows about the two models are closely related in the manner predicted by the theory, the relationship persisting over a mach number range of 092 to conecylinder vary linearly only over the small angleofattack range of approximately 1 and that the aerodynamic loading at sonic speed compares favorably with jones' slenderwing theory    the results of the investigation suggest that at transonic speeds and at small angles of attack the calculation of all aerodynamic characteristics of slender, threedimensional shapes can be made by use of transonic slenderbody theory when the pressures on the equivalent body of revolution are known, either by experiment, or by an adequate nonlinear theory   from transonic slenderbody theory it is deduced that the slenderness required for this application is the same as that required for the successful application of the transonic area rule
