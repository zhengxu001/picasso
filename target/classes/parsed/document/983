983  addendum to 'heat transfer to satellite vehicles reentering the atmosphere   detra, rw, kemp, nh and riddell, fr  jet propulsion, vol 27, december 1957  pp 125657   addendum to 'heat transfer to satellite vehicles reentering the atmosphere  the original paper gave a correlation formula for stagnation point heat transfer rate to a blunt body of revolution in hypersonic flow  this note gives a somewhat refined version, based on further calculation and shock tube data  its effect on the conclusions of the original paper is  negligible except at surface temperature parameters of over 5000 rft1/8  in other problems, where heat transfer rate itself is important, it can make a significant defference
