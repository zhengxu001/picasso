1393  heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution   sibulkin,mj  j ae scs 19, 1952, 570  heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution  in order to determine the temperature distribution over a body moving through the atmosphere, a knowledge of the local heattransfer coefficients is required   for slender sharpnosed bodies, the heattransfer coefficients are frequently approximated by using the comparable flatplate values  however, for bluntnosed bodies, flatplate solutions are not applicable near the forward stagnation point   since the greatest rate of heat transfer may occur at the forward stagnation point, its value should be investigated   in this note a theoretical solution is given for the heat transfer near the forward stagnation point of a body of revolution assuming laminar, incompressible, lowspeed flow   the comparable solution for twodimensional flow has been given by squire   in the case of a bluntnosed body moving with supersonic velocity, the flow behind the central portion of the bow wave is subsonic, and it is possible that a lowspeed solution, using as /freestream/ conditions those behind the center of the bow wave, will apply near the stagnation point
