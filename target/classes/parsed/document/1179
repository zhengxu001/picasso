1179  a theory of asymmetric hypersonic bluntbody flows   swigart,rj  aiaa jnl 1963, 1034  a theory of asymmetric hypersonic bluntbody flows  twodimensional asymmetric and threedimensional inviscid bluntbody flows are analyzed using a new method   the method is inverse, that is, the shockwave shape and freestream conditions are taken as known, and the body shape and flow field are to be determined  results at zero angle of attack are obtained as a special case of the general problem   solutions at zero angle are calculated for a variety of body shapes at freestream mach numbers ranging from infinity to 185   the ratio of specific heats, is taken as 14   comparison with results obtained using van dyke and garabedian numerical solutions indicates that the method under consideration is more accurate than the van dyke method for determining standoff distance  solutions are obtained for parabolic and paraboloidal shock waves at small angle of attack and infinite freestream mach number, assumes the values 14, 12, 11, and 105   for all cases, the streamline that wets the body passes through the shock wave slightly above the point where the shock is normal and thus does not possess maximum entropy   these results provide counter examples to the conjecture that any isolated convex body in a supersonic stream is wetted by the streamline of maximum entropy
