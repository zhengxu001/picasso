1281  turbulent heat transfer on bluntnosed bodies in twodimensional and general threedimensional hypersonic flow   vagliolaurin,r  j ae scs 1960, 27  turbulent heat transfer on bluntnosed bodies in twodimensional and general threedimensional hypersonic flow    recent results obtained for threedimensional laminar boundary layers are extended to the turbulent case   it is shown that in the presence of highly cooled surfaces and of moderate mach numbers of the outer stream, the crossflow and the pertaining reynolds stresses in a general threedimensional turbulent boundary layer are negligible even for large transverse pressure gradients   a correlation due to mager between two dimensional compressible and incompressible turbulent boundary layers is extended to the problem in question   from a study of the transformation and of its implications, a rapid method for the analysis of the boundarylayer flow under the subject conditions is established   in the absence of general three dimensional data, a comparison with experiments and with the predictions of other known analyses is carried out for several axisymmetric configurations, the results of the method presented here exhibit good agreement with the data   the range of validity of the cold wall approximation for general threedimensional problems is estimated qualitatively on the basis of recent measurements in laminar flow, the argument being that, for either zero or favorable streamwise pressure gradients, smaller threedimensional effects are to be expected in a turbulent boundary layer, as compared to a laminar layer
