1350  effects of jet billowing on stability of missiletype bodies at mach 3 85   salmi,rj  nasa tnd284, 1960  effects of jet billowing on stability of missiletype bodies at mach 3 85    the interference effects of a billowing jet on the forces and moments of two missiletype bodies were investigated in the nasa lewis 2by 2foot mach 385 wind tunnel  to simulate a rocket jet, pressurized nitrogen was exhausted from an annular sonic nozzle    the results indicate that for both models the stability parameter moment coefficient with angle of attack) in the region of zero angle of attack was favorably influenced by the interference resulting from separation due to jet billowing  schlieren photographs are presented that show the separation due to the jet billowing at various pressure ratios and angles of attack
