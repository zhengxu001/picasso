1351  exploratory tests of the effects of jet plumes on the flow over cone cylinder flare bodies   falanga,ra  nasa tnd1000, 1962  exploratory tests of the effects of jet plumes on the flow over cone cylinder flare bodies    schlieren photographs have been taken of the flow over conecylinderflare bodies to study the extent of boundarylayer separation due to the presence of rocket jet plumes   tests were made of three conecylinderflare configurations in the langley 11inch hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of 965 and in the langley unitary plan wind tunnel at a mach number of 465 with two additional configurations   the stream reynolds number varied from approximately 317,000 to 582,000 based on model length   the conical flares had halfangles of 7 or 13 and contained one of two test nozzles with a design mach number of 372 or 453  the test nozzles were operated with compressed air and were designed to simulate a solidpropellant rocket motor operating at altitudes between to freestream staticpressure ratio varied from jet off to 1,150 for the test nozzle with a design mach number of 372 and from jet off to mach number of 453   for most of the tests the angleofattack range was 0 to 4, some additional tests were made at 2 and 4    measurements taken from flow pictures indicated that at zero angle of attack on all configurations tested with jet on the boundary layer separates ahead of the flarecylinder juncture and the separation point moves toward the conecylinder juncture with an increase in pressure ratio   increasing angle of attack reduced the extent of boundarylayer separation on the windward side as did increasing the stream mach number from 465 to 965   other parameters which tended to reduce the extent of boundarylayer separation were  number, (b) decreasing stream reynolds number, and (c) displacing nozzle exit rearward
