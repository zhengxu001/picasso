753  development of a quasisteady approach to flutter and correlation with kernelfunction results   gravitz,si, laidlaw,wr, bryce,ww and cooper,re  jaescs 29, 1962, 445  development of a quasisteady approach to flutter and correlation with kernelfunction results    the quasisteady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or theoretical steadystate aerodynamic data to arrive at increased understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases, acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions  circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is included in the evaluation of the air forces   situations requiring the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation are specified    a quasiunsteady approach is also discussed, in which the approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter is included in simple modifications of quasisteady parameters    closedform solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics  application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of threedimensional multidegreeoffreedom lifting surfaces    a specific planform is evaluated in the machnumber range from zero to two   quasisteady, quasiunsteady, and kernelfunction results are compared subsonically   quasisteady results are utilized supersonically    primary applications of the quasisteady approach are in the areas of preliminary design and parametervariation studies, modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force compatibility with available steadystate data, and flutter evaluation of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by steadystate aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available
