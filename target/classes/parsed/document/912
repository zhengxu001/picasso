912  the axisymmetric freeconvection temperature field along a vertical thin cylinder   hama,pr, recesso,jv and christiaens,j  j ae scs 1959, 335  the axisymmetric freeconvection temperature field along a vertical thin cylinder    with a view to studying the effect of strong transverse curvature on boundarylayer problems, the axisymmetric free convection problem along a vertical thin cylinder is investigated theoretically as well as experimentally   a theory is developed as an extension of the pohlhausen solution of a thick axisymmetric laminar boundary layer by mark and by glauert and lighthill   experiments consist of a thermocouple survey of the temperature field over an electricallyheated brass cylinder of diameter and 10 ft height and an interferometric study of the density field over a bare tungsten wire of 002in diameter and 5 ft height   the thermallayer thicknesses are about five and fifty times the radii of the cylinders, respectively  experimental results of the local heattransfer coefficient are in excellent agreement with the theory   this, in turn, justifies the theories of laminar boundary layer along a thin cylinder, at least indirectly
