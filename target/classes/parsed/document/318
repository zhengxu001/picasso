318  inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodies   maslen,sh and moeckel,we  j ae scs 24, 1957  inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodies    two methods are shown for the calculation of the flow field between a blunt body and the shock associated with it for the case of hypersonic flow   real gas effects are included   the solutions consider only symmetric flowsthat is, symmetric bodies at zero incidence    one method consists in tracing successive stream tubes around the body and leads to iterations on the initially assumed position of the shock   the second is an integral method closely analogous to the karmanpohlhausen procedure for boundary layers   a distinction is made between roundnosed and flatnosed bodies, and both cases are discussed    a specific example corresponding to a reentry missile situation is calculated, the two methods agree within a few per cent  comparison is also made with other known solutions in the stagnation region
