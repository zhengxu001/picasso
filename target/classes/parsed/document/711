711  an investigation at subsonic speeds of aerodynamic characteristics at angles of attack from dash 4degrees to 100degrees of a deltawing reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels   spencer, b  nasa tm x288, 1960   an investigation at subsonic speeds of aerodynamic characteristics at angles of attack from dash 4degrees to 100degrees of a deltawing reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels  an investigation was made at subsonic speeds in the langley highspeed lifting reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels  the configuration is of the type used in a high angleofattack /near 90degree/  reentry to minimize aerodynamic heating  by unfolding the wingtip panels into the airstream, a moderate angleofattack glide is used for a controlled landing  the basic configuration tested utilized a whose area was 25 percent of the total wing area  the effects of varying the plan form and size of the wingtip panels was studied as well  as the effects of unfolding the wingtip panels in a high angle ofattack attitude  tests were made at mach numbers of 040, 060, and
