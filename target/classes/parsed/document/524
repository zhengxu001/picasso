524  stagnation point heat transfer in partially ionized air   rozycki,rc and fenster,sj  j ae scs 29, 1962  stagnation point heat transfer in partially ionized air    comparison of heattransfer rates, obtained by using transport properties recently reported by peng and pindroh, with rates based on hansen thermodynamic and transport properties   it is shown that the heattransfer rates based on the peng and pindroh data are 20 to 30 lower for the velocity range of 25,000 to 40,000 ft sec
