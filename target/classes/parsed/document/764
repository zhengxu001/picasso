764  breathing vibrations of a circular shell with an internal liquid   lindholm,us, kana,dd and abramson,hn  j ae scs 29, 1962, 1052  breathing vibrations of a circular shell with an internal liquid    resonant breathing frequencies and mode shapes are determined experimentally for a thinwalled, circular cylindrical shell containing a nonviscous incompressible liquid   the resonant frequencies determined for the full shell are in good agreement with those predicted by reissner shallowshell vibration theory with the inclusion of an apparentmass term for the liquid   the effect of the internal liquid on the shell mode shapes is significant only for the partially full shell   in this case the circumferential node lines tend to shift toward the bottom or filled portion of the shell    excitation of lowfrequency liquidsloshing motion by highfrequency forced oscillation of a partially filled shell occurred in many cases   this lowfrequency liquid response is tentatively explained as being excited by a beat frequency in the forced oscillation   a similar type of response has been reported by yarymovych in axially excited rigid tanks
