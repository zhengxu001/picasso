921  slenderbody theoryreview and extension   adams, mc and sears, wr  j aero sc v 20, february 1953   slenderbody theoryreview and extension  the approximate theory of flow about slender bodies and wings originated  by munk and jones is reviewed  it is presented here in a form that emphasizes the relation to the sourcesink methods of von karman and others  the extension to noncircular bodies is made for subsonic flow, paralleling ward extension for supersonic flow  the calculation of pressures and forces and the extension of the theory to unsteady flows are reviewed, and some discrepancies in the published literature are explained  finally, interpreting the jones slenderwing result as the first term of  an expansion in powers of a breadth parameter /eg, aspect ratio/, it is shown how a more accurate theory can be developed by carrying additional terms for both subsonic and supersonic speeds  this theory of notsoslender wings is applied to some practical wing problems, including direct problems of flow past given wings and problems of wing design for minimum drag  the accuracy of the new results is assessed by  comparison with linearized supersonicairfoil theory for the special case of a flat delta wing
