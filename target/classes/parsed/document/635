635  heat transfer and pressure distributions on a hemispherecylinder and a bluffafterbody model in methaneair combustion products and in air   irving weinstein  national aeronautics and space administration  technical note d1503  heat transfer and pressure distributions on a hemispherecylinder and a bluffafterbody model in methaneair combustion products and in air  an experimental investigation has been made to indicate the validity of using methaneair combustion products as the test medium for aerodynamic heating and loading tests   tests were conducted on a hemispherecylinder and on a bluffafterbody model, both in methaneair combustion products and in air alone, and covered a range of mach numbers from 6 to the data showed that the nondimensional heatingrate distribution along a hemispherecylinder as obtained in combustion products was in good agreement with that obtained in air, and the results were in reasonable agreement with theory   the stagnationpoint heating rates in air and in combustion products over the hemispherecylinder agreed within 10 percent of the theoretical values   the pressure distributions around a hemispherecylinder obtained from tests in combution products were in good agreement with those obtained in air and could be predicted by newtonian flow theory   the tests in combustion products of a bluffafterbody model produced nondimensional heattransfer coefficients which were in fair agreement with results obtained in air
