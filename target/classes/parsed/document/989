989  incompressible nonviscous bladetoblade flow through a pump rotor with splitter vanes   kramer, jj et al  nasa tn d1186, 1962   incompressible nonviscous bladetoblade flow through a pump rotor with splitter vanes  the nonviscous flow through a mixedflow pump impeller having one splitter vane between adjacent main blades has been analyzed on a bladetoblade surface of revolution using a previously reported analysis method  solutions were obtained for a variety of flow conditions including several cases in which whirl is imparted to the flow upstream of the impeller  the velocity distributions on the mainblade surfaces and on the splittervane surfaces in the region of the splitter vane were strongly dependent on the assumed location of the rear stagnation points  solutions were obtained by assuming values of slip factor and of division of  flow around the splitter in addition to assuming the location of the rear stagnation points  these solutions indicated that the velocity distributions in the splittervane region are largely determined by the division of flow around the splitter vane and that only the region in the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge is affected by the slip factor  blade surface velocities were obtained from two approximate methods by specifying flow division and slip factor, and these results are compared  with the more exact solutions of the analysis
