663  viscous flow along a flat plate moving at high speeds   kuo,yh  jaescs 23, 1956, 125  viscous flow along a flat plate moving at high speeds    by the distortion of coordinates, it is shown that, in the case of supersonic viscous flow past a flat plate, the boundarylayer and simple wave theories can be combined to give a complete representation of the velocity and pressure fields   consistent firstorder solutions are considered   an expression for the induced pressure on the plate, correct to the second order, is obtained   at high mach numbers the important parameter satisfies the hypersonic similarity law , and for arbitrary mach and reynolds numbers and for different gases, the theoretical curve correlates closely the experimental data   asymptotic shock curve and skinfriction coefficient are also deduced, but the experimental verifications are yet to be made
