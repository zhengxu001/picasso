516  freeflight measurements of the dynamic longitudinal stability characteristics of a wind tunnel interference model (m=0 92 to 1 35)   greenwood,gh  rae tnaero2798, 1961  freeflight measurements of the dynamic longitudinal stability characteristics of a wind tunnel interference model (m=0 92 to 1 35)    the dynamic longitudinalstability characteristics of a standard wind tunnel interference model have been investigated in free flight over a mach number range of 092 to 135    measurements of liftcurve slope and manoeuvre margin were obtained, and are compared with results from transonictunnel tests under low blockage conditions    the analysis was extended to obtain damping derivatives to allow comparison to be made with possible future dynamic tests in wind tunnels on the standard shape
