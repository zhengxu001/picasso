1223  inviscidincompressibleflow theory of static twodimensional solid jets, in proximity to the ground   strand,t  j ae scs 1962, 170  inviscidincompressibleflow theory of static twodimensional solid jets, in proximity to the ground    the inviscidincompressibleflow theory of static two dimensional solid jets impinging orthogonally on the ground is presented using conformal mapping methods    it is shown that the thrust of a solid jet at constant power initially decreases as the ground is approached   the magnitude of the thrust out of ground effect is regained only at a very low heighttojet width ratio (approximately 055)   the maximuin decrease is about 6 percent   the ground effect on solid jets is thus largely unfavorable
