1112  unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender body of revolution in supersonic flow   bond,r and packard,bb  nasa tnd859, 1961  unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender body of revolution in supersonic flow    linearized slenderbody theory is applied to the computation of aerodynamic forces on an oscillating, or deforming, body in supersonic flow   the undeformed body is a body of revolution and the deformed body is represented by movement of a line through the centers of the cross sections which are assumed to remain circular   the time dependence is based on sinusoidal motion    for a body of vanishing thickness the slenderbody theory yields the apparent mass approximation as it is obtained for incompressible crossflow around a cylinder    both linearized slenderbody theory and the apparent mass approximation are used to calculate the pitchingmoment coefficients on a rigid slender body with a parabolic arc nose cone, and these coefficients are compared with some experimental results
