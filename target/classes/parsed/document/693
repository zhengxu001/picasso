693  investigation of jet effects on a flat surface downstream of the exit of  a simulated turbojet nacelle at a freestream mach number of 139   bressette, we and leiss, a   investigation of jet effects on a flat surface downstream of the exit of  a simulated turbojet nacelle at a freestream mach number of 139  an investigation at a freestream mach number of 139 utilizing a blowdowntype tunnel was made to determine the effects of a propulsive jet on a zero angleofattack wing surface located in the vicinity of both a choked convergent nozzle and a convergentdivergent nozzle  staticpressure surveys were made on a flat surface that was located in the vicinity of the propulsive jet  the nozzles were operated over a varied range of both exit static and totalpressure ratios at different within the scope of this investigation, it was found that shock waves, formed in the external flow because of the presence of the jet exhaust, impinged on the flat surface and greatly altered the pressure distribution  an integration of this pressure distribution for the choked convergent nozzle, with the location of the propulsivejet exit varied from 1747 jetexit diameters to 4981 jetexit diameters below the wing  surface, resulted in a positive incremental normal force on the wing at  all positions
