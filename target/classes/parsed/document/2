2  simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity   tingyili  department of aeronautical engineering, rensselaer polytechnic institute troy, ny  simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity  in the study of highspeed viscous flow past a twodimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body   consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer   such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate   the situation is somewhat different from prandtl classical boundarylayer problem  in prandtl original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundarylayer problem the inviscid free stream must be considered as rotational   the possible effects of vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby   in the present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity is investigated   it can be shown that this problem can again be treated by the boundarylayer approximation, the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity   the discussion here is restricted to twodimensional incompressible steady flow
