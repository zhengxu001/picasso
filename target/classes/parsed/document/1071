1071  stability of thin torispherical shells under uniform internal pressure   mescall,j  nasa tnd1510, 1962, 671  stability of thin torispherical shells under uniform internal pressure    the stability of the toroidal portion of a torispherical shell under internal pressure is considered from the point of view of the linear buckling theory   a detailed stress analysis of the prebuckled shell is made employing asymptotic integration   the change in potential energy of the shell is then minimized using a rayleighritz procedure for actual computation of the critical pressure   numerical results reveal that elastic buckling may occur for very thin shells whose material has a relatively high value of the ratio of yield stress to elastic modulus
