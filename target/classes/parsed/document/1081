1081  numerical solution of the navierstokes equations for the flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds number 40   kawaguti, m  j phys soc japan, v 8, no 6 p 747, 1953   numerical solution of the navierstokes equations for the flow around a circular cylinder at reynolds number 40  the steady twodimensional flow around a circular cylinder submerged in a viscous fluid for the case r 40 is investigated, integrating numerically the exact navierstokes equations  the main results are as follows  /i/ the steady flow solution exists even for the reynolds number as high as 40  moreover, it seems that the solution goes over smoothly to the solution of the kirchhoff discontinuous flow theory which seems to be the limiting flow for the case r  /ii/ the flow pattern and the coefficients of pressure and drag are in good agreement with the experimental data
