272  oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory   rodden, w + and revell, jd  j ae scs 1960, 451  oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory    the shock tube is shown to be a feasible research tool for conducting boundarylayer transition experiments   the use of the shock tube permits the study of transition with highly cooled boundary layers, as may be encountered on hypersonic vehicles    boundarylayer transition investigations have been made on optically polished pyrex hemispherecylinder and ellipsecylinder models with stagnationtowall enthalpy ratios between 45 and roughness estimated to be less than 1 microinch (rms)  transition was detected by measurements of the heattransfer rates on the model surface    the shock tube experiments indicated that a characteristic feature of transition of a highly cooled boundary layer on a hemisphere was the simultaneous occurrence of transition over the entire supersonic portion of the hemisphere   this implies that transition first occurred in the sonic region   the transition reynolds number (based on local fluid properties at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the momentum thickness) in the sonic region increased from about 225 to 325 as the stagnation towall enthalpy ratio increased from about 95 to 295   transition occurred along the cylindrical portion of the hemispherecylinder model at a nearly constant momentum thickness reynolds number, increasing from about 400 to 625 as the stagnation towall enthalpy ratio increased from about 95 to 295    the highly cooled boundary layers obtained on the cylindrical portion of the shock tube hemispherecylinder model provided an extension of nasa transition results obtained on a cooled hemisphereconecylinder model in a wind tunnel   the transition reynolds numbers obtained from these shock tube data were of the same order of magnitude as the minimum transition reynolds numbers obtained in the windtunnel experiments   the results indicate that, for practical purposes, boundarylayer cooling is not a critical transition parameter for blunt bodies with a highly cooled boundary layer resulting from a stagnation towall enthalpy ratio of about 3 to 30   that is, the transition reynolds number did not vary significantly with boundary layer cooling in this cooling range, but transition always occurred at a low reynolds number (between about 350,000 and 750,000 based on local external properties and a distance along the body surface from the stagnation point)    the boundarylayer history (body shape history) appeared to be an important parameter affecting the magnitude of the reynolds number for transition and the amount of increase in the transition reynolds number with increased boundarylayer cooling   that is, transition occurred at a lower reynolds number on the ellipsecylinder configuration than on the hemispherecylinder   also, the increase in transition reynolds number with an increase in boundarylayer cooling was even less significant for the ellipsecylinder than the hemispherecylinder
