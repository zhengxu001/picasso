1109  unsteady laminar compressible boundary layers on an infinite plate with suction or injection   yang,kt  j ae scs 1959, 653  unsteady laminar compressible boundary layers on an infinite plate with suction or injection    this study deals with unsteady compressible laminar boundary layers on an infinitely extended porous plate   an integral solution based on two types of assumed velocity and temperature profiles is presented for the general case where the unsteady freestream velocity and rate of surface suction or injection are both arbitrary   also indicated is an exact solution, applicable, however, only to certain specific unsteady freestream and surface suction or injection variations   the reliability and range of validity of the integral solutions is then established on the basis of numerical results from the exact solution   finally, several general qualitative conclusions of the unsteady effects of freestream velocity and surface suction or injection on laminar boundarylayer behavior are made
