821  inelastic column theory   shanley,fr  j ae scs 14, 1949, 261  inelastic column theory    the action of a column in the plastic range is analyzed on the basis that bending may proceed simultaneously with increasing axial load   this leads to a new column formula that includes both the tangentmodulus (engesser) and the reducedmodulus the tangentmodulus load and that the column load increases with increasing lateral deflection, approaching the reducedmodulus load as a limit if the tangent modulus is assumed to remain constant
