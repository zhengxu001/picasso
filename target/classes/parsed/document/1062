1062  an experimental and theoretical investigation of secondorder wingbody interference at high mach number   wilby,pg  ffa r91, stockholm, 1962  an experimental and theoretical investigation of secondorder wingbody interference at high mach number    the secondorder wingbody interference theory of landahl and beane is used in the theoretical calculation of the pressure distributions over the wing of a wingbody combination  results are compared with experimental values obtained from windtunnel tests, at a mach number of 735, on a conecylinder nonlifting body with a triangular wing of wedge section set at incidences of 0, 3, 6 and 10   it is shown that interference effects can be very large and can be calculated theoretically with good accuracy
