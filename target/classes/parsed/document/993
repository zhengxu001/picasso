993   the extent of the jet interference flow fields  jet effects on cylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaust against a supersonic stream at angles of attack from 90degree to 180degree   hayman, lo and mcdearmon, rw    the extent of the jet interference flow fields  jet effects on cylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaust against a supersonic stream at angles of attack from 90degree to 180degree       an investigation has been made to determine jet effects on cylindrical afterbodies housing sonic and supersonic nozzles which exhaust against a supersonic stream at angles of attack from 90 to 180  the tests were conducted at a freestream mach number of 291 and at freestream reynolds numbers, based on body diameter, of 015x106 and stream static pressure investigated was from jet off to about 400      the data presented herein showed that, in general, variation of the ratio of jet total pressure to freestream static pressure, jetexit mach number, and ratio of jetexit diameter to body diameter had large influences on the body pressures on the windward halves of the afterbodies and negligible influences on the leeward pressures  there was a negligible effect of reynolds number on the body pressures  the ratio of jet total pressure to freestream static pressure also had a large influence on the base pressures at all angles of attack  schlieren studies showed details of the shockwave structure caused by the jet and the extent of the jet interference flow fields
