949  charts for equilibrium flow properties of air in hypervelocity nozzles   jorgensen,lh and baum,gm  nasa tnd1333, 1962  charts for equilibrium flow properties of air in hypervelocity nozzles    for initial stagnation pressures up to 1,000 atmospheres and stagnation enthalpies up to 10,000 btu per pound, nozzleflow properties for equilibrium air have been computed and plotted on charts   the work of nasa tn d693 has been extended to include flow properties for closer intervals of specified stagnation enthalpies   properties which have been charted as a function of mach number are as follows   temperature, pressure, density, velocity, area ratio, dynamic pressure, reynolds number, isentropic exponent, and molecular weight ratio   ratios of temperature, pressure, and density across normal shock waves are also charted, and weightflow rate is plotted as a function of stagnation enthalpy
