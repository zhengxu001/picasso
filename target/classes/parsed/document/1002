1002  preliminary investigations of spiked bodies at hypersonic speeds   bogdonoff, sm and vas, ie  jnl aero sci february 1959, p 6574   preliminary investigations of spiked bodies at hypersonic speeds  generally accepted solutions for the problems of hypersonic flight appear, at the moment, to be centered around the use of blunt bodies to minimize the heattransfer rates  there are, however, several other solutions to the problem, and, as part of an exploratory study of these solutions, a detailed examination has been made of the flow over blunt bodies equipped with a spike  these tests, carried out at a mach number  of about 14 in the princeton helium hypersonic tunnel, have investigated the effect of varying spike lengths for flatfaced and hemisphericallynosed axially symmetric bodies  detailed pressure distributions have been obtained as well as heattransfer rates  these exploratory studies have shown that the use of a spike protruding from a hemisphericalnosed cylinder at m 14 decreased the pressure level by an order of magnitude and the heat transfer to a fraction of that measured on a hemisphere without a spike  the general technique appears to hold considerable promise for hypersonic flight
