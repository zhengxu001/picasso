1169  hangling qualities experience with several vtol research aircraft   reeder,jp  nasa tnd735, 1961  hangling qualities experience with several vtol research aircraft    all of the vtol research aircraft discussed in this paper have successfully demonstrated conversion from hovering to airplane flight and vice versa   however, control about one or more axes of these aircraft has been inadequate in hovering flight  furthermore, ground interference effects have been severe in some cases and have accentuated the inadequacy of control in hovering and very low speed flight    stalling of wing surfaces has resulted in limitations in levelflight deceleration and in descent, particularly for the tiltwing aircraft, which in this case is a very rudimentary type  minor modifications to the wing leading edge have, however, produced surprisingly large and encouraging reductions in adverse stall effects    height control in hovering and in lowspeed flight has proved to be a problem for the aircraft not having direct control of the pitch of the rotors   the other systems have shown undesirable time lags in development of a thrust change
