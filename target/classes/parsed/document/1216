1216  pressure distribution in regions of stepinduced turbulent separation   vasilu,j  j ae scs 1962, 596  pressure distribution in regions of stepinduced turbulent separation    an analysis is made of the pressure distribution in the separatedflow region ahead of a step, using the concept of the turbulent mixing coefficient of crocco and lees and the /jetflow/ model of chapman with some modification   on the basis of a variable mixing coefficient, a differential equation for the pressure distribution is derived, which gives the pressure rise as a function of the distance from the separation point   this equation contains the separation length as an unknown   a second equation is obtained by making a mass balance of the air entering and, leaving the /deadair/ region ahead of the step   the pressure rise and the separation distance for a given mach number are determined by solving the two equations simultaneously    the analysis yields results which are in close agreement with the experimental data on steps, obtained at princeton, particularly for m = 385   for lower mach numbers, a maximum variation of 5 percent is found between theory and experiment  use of the velocity profiles of jets, as required by the jetflow model, necessarily restricts the applicability of the present study to flows with thin boundary layers at the separation point
