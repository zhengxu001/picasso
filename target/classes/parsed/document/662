662  theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamicheating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers   stine,ha and wanlass,k  naca tn3344, 1954  theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamicheating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers    the effect of a strong, negative pressure gradient upon the local rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on the isothermal surface of an electrically heated, cylindrical body of revolution with a hemispherical nose was determined from windtunnel tests at a mach number of 197   the investigation indicated that the local heattransfer parameter, based on flow conditions just outside the boundary layer, decreased from a value of 065 010 at the stagnation point of the hemisphere to a value  of 043 005 at the junction with the cylindrical afterbody   because measurements of the static pressure distribution over the hemisphere indicated that the local flow pattern tended to become stationary as the freestream mach number was increased to 38, this distribution of heattransfer parameter is believed representative of all mach numbers greater than 197 and of temperatures less than that of dissociation   the local heattransfer parameter was independent of reynolds number based on body diameter in the range from 06x10 to 23x10    the measured distribution of heattransfer parameter agreed within theoretical distribution calculated with foreknowledge only of the pressure distribution about the body   this method, applicable to any body of revolution with an isothermal surface, combines the mangler transformation, stewartson transformation, and thermal solutions to the falknerskan wedgeflow problem, and thus evaluates the heattransfer rate in axisymmetric compressible flow in terms of the known heattransfer rate in an approximately equivalent twodimensional incompressible flow    measurements of recoverytemperature distributions at mach numbers of 197 and 304 yielded local recovery factors having an average value of 0823 0012 on the hemisphere which increased abruptly at the shoulder to an average value of 0840 0012 on the cylindrical afterbody   this result suggests that the usual representation of the laminar recovery factor as the square root of the prandtl number is conservative in the presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient
