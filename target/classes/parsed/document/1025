1025  note on creep buckling of columns     note on creep buckling of columns    the creep of a slightly crooked section column carrying a constant load is studied theoretically   the material of the column is characterized by a straintime relationship, under constant uniaxial stress, of the form, where is the total strain, is the constant stress, is the time, and e,a,b, and k are material constants   this form was selected because it applies to at least two alloys75st6 aluminum alloy at 600 f  and a lowalloy steel at 800 and 1,100 f   however, the analysis is intended for any material having creep properties of the same form and for which the material constants are known   a straintime relationship under variable uniaxial stress, necessary for the column analysis, is formulated from the constantstress properties with the aid of shanley engineering hypotheses of creep    the analysis leads to the conclusion that the lateral deflection approaches infinitythat is, the column collapsesin finite time  results are given showing the maximum length of time the column can support a given load before it collapses and the growth of stresses, strains, and deflections prior to collapse
