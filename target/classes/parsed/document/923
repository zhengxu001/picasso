923  methods for estimating lift interference of wingbody combinations at supersonic speeds   nielsen,jn and kaattari,ge  naca til2950  methods for estimating lift interference of wingbody combinations at supersonic speeds    the modified slenderbody method used by nielsen, katzen, and tang in rm a50f06, 1950, to predict the lift and moment interference of triangular wingbody combinations has been adapted to combinations with other than triangular wings   that part of the method for predicting the effect of the body on the wing has been retained, but a new method for predicting the effect of the wing on the body has been presented   these methods have been applied to the prediction of the liftcurve slopes of nearly 100 triangular, rectangular, and trapezoidal wingbody configurations   the estimated and experimental values for the liftcurve slopes agree for most of the cases within 10 percent   some of the higherorder effects that must be taken into account in a theory that is to give greater accuracy than the present one are discussed   a numerical example illustrating the method is included
