265  some instabilities arising from the interaction between shock waves and boundary layer   lambourne,nc  npl aero348, 1958  some instabilities arising from the interaction between shock waves and boundary layer    a brief review is made of the available information concerning the flow fluctuations and instabilities arising from shockinduced separation in the flow over aerofoils and wings   the influence this phenomenon has on the oscillatory behaviour of aerofoils and control surfaces is also briefly discussed    a more detailed consideration is devoted to a recent investigation at the npl into the part played by shockinduced separation in the instability of a control surface
