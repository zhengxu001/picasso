212  theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic turbines   stratford,bs and sansome,ge  arc r + m 3275, 1960  theory and tunnel tests of rotor blade for supersonic turbines    in special circumstances where a large work output is required from a turbine in a single stage it is necessary to use high pressure ratios across the nozzle blades, thus producing supersonic velocities at inlet to the rotor   as part of an investigation into such turbines, several designs for the interblade passages of the rotor have been tested in a twodimensional tunnel, a design theory being developed concurrently    the first design, featuring constant passage width and curvature as in steamturbine practice, but having thin leading and trailing edges, was found to suffer from focusing of the compression waves from the concave surface, with consequent flow separation from the opposite convex surface   it gave a velocity coefficient of measured at an inlet mach number of 190 and turning angle of 140 deg   the measured value compares favourably with values from previous steam tests, where the results have been in the range from 065 to 092    from theoretical reasoning, and from additional test observations, a subsequent passage was designed having an inlet transition length of small curvature, leading to a freevortex passage of double the transition curvature, a small amount of contraction was incorporated  schlieren photographs showed the flow in this passage to be almost shock free   a thin region of lowenergy air existed close to the convex surface, but liquidinjection tests located only one small bubble of reversed flow  pressure traverses at exit indicated a velocity coefficient of 0952, based on the areamean total pressure  when allowance is made for turning angle and reynolds number this result appears to compare quite favourably with previous work    it would seem that the optimum blade pitching in a turbine would be about 20 to 30 per cent closer than in a twodimensional cascade   however, the resultant pitching tends to become very close, except at very large turning angles, with the result that in some applications difficulties could arise in the practical design and manufacture    several uncertainties remain and the present design must be regarded as still experimental
