293  recent studies on the effect of cooling on boundary layer transition at mach 4  wisniewski,rj and jack,jr  j ae scs 28, 1961  recent studies on the effect of cooling on boundary layer transition at mach 4 the advent of highspeed flight has necessitated the study of boundarylayer transition on highly cooled bodies  investigations such as those of references 14 have concentrated on this problem and have indicated, contrary to the trends predicted by smalldisturbance theory, that premature transition can be found with cooling   this phenomenon, commonly called detail in references 25    the purpose of this note is to report some recent transition data obtained on a cooled cone in a mach 4 wind tunnel   the model, a sharptip cone (included angle 135), was cooled by liquid nitrogen to a temperature of 340 f   the cooling method and the data analysis are similar to that described in reference 3
