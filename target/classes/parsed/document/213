213  the performance of supersonic turbine nozzles   stratford,bs and sansome,ge  arc r + m 3273, 1959  the performance of supersonic turbine nozzles    an investigation has been conducted at the national gas turbine establishment into the performance of turbines having high pressure ratios per stage   the present report discusses the mode of operation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines, and describes a cascade experiment   both theory and experiment demonstrate that the conditions imposed upon the supersonic flow immediately downstream of the nozzles (eg, by a following row of rotor blades) exert an overriding influence upon the nozzle outlet flow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressure ratio obtainable across the nozzleproviding that the axial component of velocity is subsonic   this is an important difference from the more familiar flow of subsonic turbine nozzles, where, for example, the downstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by the nozzle blade shape and spacing   a suitable test technique using a closedjet tunnel is demonstrated    the particular nozzles tested, of convergentdivergent form, had a straightsided divergent portion of to axial direction) and a design mach number of 2  the flow was found to be well behaved as regards shock pattern, losses, and starting over the range of pressure ratios testedbetween 9 1 and 19 1   in particular the efficiency at the design pressure ratio of 166 1 was high, the velocity coefficient calculated from traverses of pitot and static tubes being 098    for the conversion of pitot to total pressure at a mach number of 25 a high accuracy is important in the measurement of the static pressure, nevertheless readings from a conventional fourhole instrument appear to be reliable
