634  effects of leading edge bluntness on flutter characteristics of some square planform doublewedge airfoils at a mach number of 15 4  goetz,rc  nasa tnd1487, 1962  effects of leading edge bluntness on flutter characteristics of some square planform doublewedge airfoils at a mach number of 15 4   results are presented from a windtunnel investigation in helium flow at a mach number of 154   the models were squareplanform, doublewedge, shaftmounted airfoils with leading and trailingedge radii of 0, 1, 3, and 6 percent chord  in general, the tests indicate that bluntness effects on the model flutter characteristics are stabilizing as the leadingedge radius is increased from 0 to destabilizing with further increase in bluntness    results of flutter calculations made by using newtonian theory aerodynamics and a combination of newtonian theory and piston theory aerodynamics in conjunction with an uncoupled twomode analysis are compared with experimental results  the pistontheory results accurately predicted flutter speeds for the models with
