188  an analysis of base pressure at supersonic velocities and comparison with experiment   chapman, dean r   naca report 1051  an analysis of base pressure at supersonic velocities and comparison with experiment     in the first part of the investigation an analysis is made of base pressure in an inviscid fluid, both for twodimensional and axially symmetric flow  it is shown that for twodimensional flow, and also for the flow over a body of revolution with a cylindrical sting attached to the base, there are an infinite number of possible solutions satisfying all necessary boundary conditions at anh given freestream mach numger  for the particular case of a body having no sting attached only one solution is possible in an inviscid flow, but it corresponds to zero base drag  accordingly, it is concluded that a strictly inviscidflow theory cannot be satisfactory for practical applications     an approximate semiempirical analysis for base pressure in a viscous fluid is developed in a second part of the investigation  the semiempirical analysis is based partly on inviscidflow calculations  in this theory an attempt is made to allow for the effects of mach number, reynolds number, profile shape, and type of boundarylayer flow  some measurements of base pressure in twodimensional and axially symmetric flow are presented for purposes of comparison  experimental results then are presented concerning the support interference effect of a cylindrical sting, and the interference effect of a reflected air wave on measurements of base pressure in a supersonic wind tunnel
