546  measurements of aerodynamic heating on a 15 cone of graded wall thickness at a mach number of 6 8  woodley,jg  rae tnaero2847, 1962  measurements of aerodynamic heating on a 15 cone of graded wall thickness at a mach number of 6 8   this note describes transient wall temperature measurements made on a in an airstream of mach number 68    the skin of the model was sufficiently thin to allow it to reach zero heat transfer conditions within a running time of one minute    in order to reduce effects of longitudinal heat conduction during a run the electroformednickel skin of the model was made with graded thickness, and as a result fairly uniform temperature distributions along the surface were obtained at all times in both the laminar and turbulent regions    values of heat transfer, calculated from the wall temperaturetime histories using the thinwall temperature are compared to theoretical estimates using the intermediate enthalpy method 10, 11
