857  experimental studies of flutter of buckled rectangular panels at mach numbers from 1 2 to 3 0 including effects of pressure differential and of panel widthlength ratio   sylvester,ma  nasa tnd833, 1961  experimental studies of flutter of buckled rectangular panels at mach numbers from 1 2 to 3 0 including effects of pressure differential and of panel widthlength ratio    experimental panel flutter data have been obtained at mach numbers from 12 to 30 for buckled rectangular panels and the effect of a pressure differential has been determined   increasing the pressure differential was effective in eliminating flutter on most of the panels tested   the effects of the variables in the panel flutter parameter sure, e is young modulus, and t and l are the panel thickness and length, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels clamped on the front and rear edges and a critical value of this parameter of 044 is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel widthlength ratio is 069   an estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckled panels clamped on four edges, with widthlength ratios of 021 to 40  this boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than the panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than approximately 05   panels clamped on four edges and buckled in two half waves in the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible to flutter   the results of limited tests on panels with applied damping, curvature, and lengthwise stiffeners are also presented and discussed
