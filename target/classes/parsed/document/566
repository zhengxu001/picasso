566  investigation of local heat transfer and pressure drag characteristics of a yawed circular cylinder at supersonic speeds   goodwin,g, creager,mo and winkler,el  naca rma55h31, 1956  investigation of local heat transfer and pressure drag characteristics of a yawed circular cylinder at supersonic speeds    local heattransfer coefficients, temperature recovery factors, and pressure distributions were measured on a circular cylinder at a nominal mach number of 39 over a range of freestream reynolds numbers from from 0 to 44    it was found that yawing the cylinder reduced the local heattransfer coefficients, the average heattransfer coefficients, and the pressure drag coefficients over the front side of the cylinder   for example, at is reduced by 34 percent and the pressure drag by 60 percent   the amount of reduction may be predicted by a theory presented herein   local temperature recovery factors were also reduced by yaw, but the amount of reduction is small compared to the reduction in heattransfer coefficients    a comparison of these data with other data obtained under widely different conditions of body and stream temperature, mach number, and reynolds number indicates that these factors have little effect upon the dropoff of heat transfer due to yaw
