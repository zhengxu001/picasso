107  on the mixing of two parallel streams   ting,lu  jmathphys 38, 1959, 153  on the mixing of two parallel streams    using the techniques of boundarylayer theory, the proper third boundary condition for the mixing of two parallel streams is derived from the compatibility condition of the higher order approximation   it is shown that the commonly adopted third boundary condition of balancing of transverse momentum is correct only for the mixing problem of two semiinfinite incompressible streams  for the fulfillment of the proper third boundary condition, the possibility of introducing the similar solution of blasius type is examined for various cases
