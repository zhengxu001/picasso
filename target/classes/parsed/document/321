321  improved numerical solution of the blasius problem with threepoint boundary conditions   christian, w j  j aero sc v 28, november, 1961   improved numerical solution of the blasius problem with threepoint boundary conditions  the blasius equation describes the velocity distribution resulting from laminar, constantpressure mixing of a stationary fluid layer and a moving stream  in connection with a numerical procedure for the univac based on analytic continuation of the function f'  highspeed computers  now make it feasible to use analytic continuation for numerical integration of singlepoint boundaryvalue problems such that, within the limits of taylor expansion, truncation error may be made arbitrarily small  a brief description of the application of the routine is given
