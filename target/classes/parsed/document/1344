1344  atmospheric entries with vehicle liftdrag ratio modulated to limit deceleration and rate of deceleration vehicles with maximum liftdrag ratio of 0 5  katzen,ed and levy,ll  nasa tnd1145, 1961  atmospheric entries with vehicle liftdrag ratio modulated to limit deceleration and rate of deceleration vehicles with maximum liftdrag ratio of 0 5   an analysis has been made of atmosphere entries for which the vehicle liftdrag ratio was modulated to maintain specified maximum decelerations and or maximum deceleration rates   the part of the vehicle drag polar used during modulation was from maximum lift coefficient to minimum drag coefficient   the entries were at parabolic velocity and the vehicle maximum liftdrag ratio was 05   twodimensional trajectory calculations were made for a nonrotating, spherical earth with an exponential atmosphere   the results of the analysis indicate that for a given initial flightpath angle, modulation generally resulted in a reduction of the maximum deceleration to 60 percent of the unmodulated value or a reduction of maximum deceleration rate to less than 50 percent of the unmodulated rate   these results were equivalent, for a maximum deceleration of 10g, to lowering the undershoot boundary 24 miles with a resulting decrease in total convective heating to the stagnation point of 22 percent  however, the maximum convective heating rate was increased 18 percent, the maximum radiative heating rate and total radiative heating were each increased about 10 percent
