685  aerodynamic effects of some configuration variables on the aeroelastic characteristics of lifting surfaces at mach numbers from 0 7 to 6 86   hanson,pw  nasa tnd984, 1961  aerodynamic effects of some configuration variables on the aeroelastic characteristics of lifting surfaces at mach numbers from 0 7 to 6 86    results of flutter tests on some simple allmovablecontroltype models are given   one set of models, which had a square planform with doublewedge airfoils with four different values of leading and trailingedge radii from 0 to 6 percent chord and airfoil thicknesses of 9, 11, at mach numbers from 07 to 686  the bendingtotorsion frequency ratio was about 033   the other set of models, which had a tapered planform with singlewedge and doublewedge airfoils with thicknesses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 percent chord, was tested at mach numbers from 07 to 398 and a frequency ratio of about 042    the tests indicate that, in general, increasing thickness has a destabilizing effect at the higher mach numbers but is stabilizing at subsonic and transonic mach numbers  doublewedge airfoils are more prone to flutter than singlewedge airfoils at comparable stiffness levels   increasing airfoil bluntness has a stabilizing effect on the flutter boundary at supersonic speeds but has a negligible effect at subsonic speeds   however, increasing bluntness may also lead to divergence at supersonic speeds    results of calculations using secondorder pistontheory aerodynamics in conjunction with a coupledmode analysis and an uncoupledmode analysis are compared with the experimental results for the sharpedge airfoils at supersonic speeds   the uncoupledmode analysis more accurately predicted the flutter characteristics of the taperedplanform models, whereas the coupledmode analysis was somewhat better for the squareplanform models  for both the uncoupled and coupledmode analyses, agreement with the experimental results improved with increasing mach number   in general, both methods of analysis gave unconservative results with respect to the experimental flutter boundaries
