877  the influence of aerodynamic heating on the flexural rigidity of a thin wing   mansfield,eh  arc r + m3115, 1957  the influence of aerodynamic heating on the flexural rigidity of a thin wing    this report considers the loss of flexural rigidity of a thin wing due to the presence of middlesurface stresses resulting from aerodynamic heating   the spanwise properties of the wing are assumed constant but the wing section is arbitrary   the loss of flexural rigidity is comparable with the corresponding loss of torsional rigidity
