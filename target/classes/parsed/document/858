858  experimental investigation at mach numbers 3 0 of the effects of thermal stress and buckling on the flutter of fourbay aluminium alloy panels with lengthwidth ratios of 10   dixon,sc, griffith,ge and bohon,hk  nasa tnd921, 1961  experimental investigation at mach numbers 3 0 of the effects of thermal stress and buckling on the flutter of fourbay aluminium alloy panels with lengthwidth ratios of 10    skinstiffener aluminum alloy panels consisting of four bays, each bay having a lengthwidth ratio of 10, were tested at a mach number of 30 at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and at stagnation temperatures from 300 f to 655 f   the panels were restrained by the supporting structure in such a manner that partial thermal expansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateral directions    a boundary faired through the experimental flutter points consisted of a flatpanel portion, a buckledpanel portion, and a transition point at the intersection of the two boundaries   in the region where a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more susceptible to flutter   in the region where a panel must be buckled when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed   this reversal in trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior
