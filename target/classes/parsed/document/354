354  laminar heattransfer and pressure measurements over bluntnosed cones at large angle of attack   victor zakkay  research associate, polytechnic institute of brooklyn, freeport, ny  laminar heattransfer and pressure measurements over bluntnosed cones at large angle of attack  tests have been conducted at a mach number of 6, in the pibal hypersonic facility, in order to determine the heattransfer and pressure distributions over a slender blunted cone at angles of attack of erature ratio, stagnation to wall, was approximately 23   the model tested has a sperical nose diameter of 10 in, a base diameter of 375 in, and a cone halfangle of 20 degrees   the measurements were made at 5 peripheral stations on the model  in this note the experimental results at a 15 degree angle of attack are presented   a more detailed analysis of the results for all angles of attack is presented in reference 1
