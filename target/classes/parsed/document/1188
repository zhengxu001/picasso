1188  factors affecting liftdrag ratios at mach numbers from 5 to 20   goebel,tp martin,jj and boyd,ja  aiaa jnl 1963, 640  factors affecting liftdrag ratios at mach numbers from 5 to 20    yawedcone working charts and an engineering method are presented and used to calculate liftdrag ratios of flattop conical wingbody arrangements at mach numbers from 5 to 20  viscous interaction effects are considered, but bluntness effects are neglected   correlations of windtunnel data in the range show that boundary layer displacement corrections to surface pressure and skin friction are required to calculate liftdrag ratios by this method whenever is greater than 02   is the freestream mach number and is the freestream reynolds number based on body length   double and singletype shock patterns, transition from one pattern to the other, and the variation of innershock position with angle of attack are described  liftdrag ratios are calculated at selected flight design points for flattop, conical body arrangements with triangular and hyperbolic wing planforms   the hyperbolic wing arrangement offers a potential l d benefit at mach 5 but not at mach 10 or above
