617  determination of upperatmosphere air density profile from satellite observations   groves, gv  proc roy soc a 252, 2834, 1959   determination of upperatmosphere air density profile from satellite observations  the theory previously developed for the changes in the perigee distance and semimajor axis of a satellite orbit due to air drag is extended to enable the airdensity profile/ieits relative variation with height/to  be derived from the motion of the orbit perigee  the solution is first obtained in terms of the change in perigee distance and then in terms of the change in the radius of the earth at the subperigee point  the scale height in the 180 and 220 km altitude regions
