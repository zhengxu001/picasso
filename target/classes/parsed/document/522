522  laminar, transitional and turbulent heat transfer to a conecylinderflare body at mach 8 0  zakkay,v and callahan,cj  j ae scs 29, 1962, 1403  laminar, transitional and turbulent heat transfer to a conecylinderflare body at mach 8 0   an experimental investigation of the laminar, transitional, and turbulent heat transfer rates over a conical cylindrical flared body is presented   regions of favorable, zero, and adverse pressure gradient on the body are investigated   the experimental results are compared with the theories available in the literature    the model chosen for this investigation is a conecylinderflare configuration consisting of a 20 semivertex conical nose portion smoothly blended by a shoulder radius into a long cylindrical body and terminated by a smooth large radius flare    the model was tested at a free stream mach number of 8, over a range of reynolds number from 03 x 10 to 16 x 10 per inch based on free stream conditions   various stagnationtowall temperature ratios were obtained by cooling the model prior to the test with liquid nitrogen   the stagnationtowall temperature ratios were 10 and 33    the theoretical predictions gave good results for the heat transfer rates in the laminar region, and fair prediction in the transitional and turbulent regimes extending over the shoulder and forward portion of the cylindrical body   over the aft portion of the cylinder and over the flare the predictions are only qualitatively correct, and underestimate the heating rate by a factor as high as 3   conversely, the /flat plate reference enthalpy/ over the aft portion of the body, but to increasingly overestimate the heating rates over the forward portion of the cylinder    a modified equation for the heat transfer coefficient in the transitional and fully turbulent region based on the fpre method is then presented   this method gives good agreement with the experimental results presented over the entire range of transitional and turbulent flow    from the results the following is concluded   cooling the wall delayed transition   by expanding the flow rapidly between the cone and the cylinder, the transition reynolds number is reached very rapidly   by making a smooth transition between the cylinder and the flare, no separation occurred at the cylindrical flare junction   the transitional and turbulent heat transfer in the presence of an adverse pressure gradient may be predicted with sufficient accuracy by the fpre method
