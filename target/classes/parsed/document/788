788  an approximate boundary layer theory for semiinfinite cylinders of arbitrary crosssection   varley, e  j fluid mech vol 3 1958, p 601614   an approximate boundary layer theory for semiinfinite cylinders of arbitrary crosssection  an estimate is given of the distribution of skin frictional force per unit length, and of displacement area, on the outside of a semiinfinite  cylinder, of arbitrary crosssection, moving steadily in a direction parallel to its generators  a pohlhausen method is employed with a velocity distribution chosen to yield zero viscous retarding force on the boundary layer approximations  /the smallness of the fluid acceleration far from the leading edge has been pointed out by batchelor reasonable results atlarge distances from the leading edge  however, for a large class of crosssections, which includes all convex crosssections and locally concave crosssections with reentrant angles greater than 1/2, the method yields the expected square root growth of the boundary layer at the leadingedge, with a fairly close approximation to the coefficient, and it is supposed that the skinfrictional force and displacement area are given with reasonable accuracy along the  whole length of the cylinder  results for the elliptic cylinder and the finite flat plate are given in  closed form, valid for the whole length of the cylinder, and are expected to be in error by at most 20 per cent  in addition, some estimate is given of the effect of corners on skin frictional force and displacement area
