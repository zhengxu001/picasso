1394  stagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersonic low density flow   neice,se, rutkowski,rw and chann,kk  j ae scs27, 1960, 387  stagnation point heat transfer measurements in hypersonic low density flow  in hypersonic, low reynolds number flow around a blunt body, the boundarylayer thickness approaches the shocklayer thickness (shock standoff distance) within the region of continuum flow   in this instance, the customary boundarylayer approximations no longer apply   hoshizaki and probstein have obtained solutions to the incompressible navierstokes equations in the stagnation region of a blunt body in this hypersonic low reynolds number flow   the results indicate that heattransfer rates are substantially higher than those predicted by incompressible boundarylayer theory   probstein indicated that the actual heattransfer rates would be correspondingly higher than the predictions of fay and riddell   these findings are of particular importance in the atmospheric entry phase of recoverable satellites
