841  on the bending of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending   seide,p and weingarten,vi  j app mech 28, 1961  on the bending of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending  the stability of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending is investigated by means of batdorf modified donnell equation and the galerkin method   the results of this investigation have shown that, contrary to the commonly accepted value, the maximum critical bending stress is for all practical purposes equal to the critical compressive stress
