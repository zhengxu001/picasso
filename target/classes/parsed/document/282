282  jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodies at mach 1 91 and 3 12   baughman,le and kochendorfer,fd  naca rm e57e06  jet effects on base pressure of conical afterbodies at mach 1 91 and 3 12    data are presented which show the effect of a jet on base pressure for a series of conical afterbodyjetnozzle combinations having boattail angles that varied from 0 to 11 and basetojet diameter ratios that varied from 111 to 267   the jet nozzles had exit angles from 0 to 20 and were designed for exit mach numbers from 10 to 32  pressure ratios up to 30 were tested for both a cold (air) and a hot numbers of 191 and 312    in general, base pressure increased for increasing values of boattail angle, nozzle angle, jet temperature, and jet total pressure and for decreasing values of basetojet diameter ratio, jet mach number, and freestream mach number   the addition of tail surfaces produced only small changes in base pressure    for all variables, base pressure is governed by the maximum pressure rise that can be supported by the wake fluid in the region of the trailing shock   the wake pressure ratio is in turn governed by the jet and freestream mach numbers adjacent to the wake region and by the state of the boundary layer on the boattail and on the nozzle    values of wake pressure ratio computed using the theory of korst, page, and childs were in good agreement with experimental values for convergent nozzles
