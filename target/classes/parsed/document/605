605  pressure measurements on a conecylinderflare configuration at small incidences for m 68   woodley, jg  rae tn aero 2739   pressure measurements on a conecylinderflare configuration at small incidences for m 68  pressure measurements were made on a slender conecylinderflare configuration, slightly blunted at the nose, for 0, 3 and 6 degrees incidence at a freestream mach number of 68  it was found that the surface pressures obtained on the cone agreed with  extrapolations to m equals 68 of theoretical values given in mit tables /kopal/for yawed cones, and that impact theory gave a good indication of the pressure level to be expected on all parts of the body where surface incidence was sufficiently large to merit its use  the semiangles of the conical and flared parts of the model were both the pressure level on the flare rose in all cases to approximately that developed upstream on the cone surface  no evidence of a marked overexpansion to pressures below the freestream value was noticed at the junction between cone and cylinder
