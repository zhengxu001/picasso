462  photothermoelasticity   gerard,g and gilbert,ac  jappmech 24, 1957  photothermoelasticity    this paper summarizes the optical and physical properties of the photoelastic model material paraplex p43 over the temperature range from room temperature to 40 f  descriptions are presented of techniques and equipment developed to obtain the modulus of elasticity, the material fringe value, and the thermalexpansion coefficient as a function of temperature   experimental investigations were conducted into the planestress problems of a disk contracting upon an elastic inclusion and the transient thermalstress field produced by a temperature differential suddenly applied to the upper edge of a long beam   the data are correlated with theory using the material properties obtained in the calibration phase   also included are photographic results of an exploratory investigation of the thermalshock phenomenon produced by the sudden application of a temperature differential upon plastic beams of various lengthdepth ratios
