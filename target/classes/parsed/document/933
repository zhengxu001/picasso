933  the characteristics of roughness from insects as observed for twodimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils   coleman,ws  j ae scs 1959, 264  the characteristics of roughness from insects as observed for twodimensional, incompressible flow past airfoils    advances in the practical development of boundarylayer control for the maintenance of extensive laminar flow have drawn attention to the problem of surface roughness, due not only to artificial irregularities such as rivet heads, lap joints, window panels, etc, but also to the kind generated in flight from impact with insects   this natural form of roughening, the effects of which have been noted, though not investigated previously, is the subject of the present paper    the phenomenon may be divided into two partsnamely, and (2) its effect upon the stability of the laminar boundary layer   windtunnel experiments with the fruit fly, drosophila, and the common housefly for the investigation of both (1) and airfoils are fully described   the former problem has also been treated mathematically in a separate paper, not yet published, agreement between theory and experiment being satisfactory in all essentials    the characteristics of the roughness profile consist principally of a pronounced peak near the leading edge, followed by an extensive area of surface over which there is a much reduced and gradually diminishing value of the excrescence height   further, it is shown that, if the severe leadingedge roughness, or its effect upon the boundary layer, can be eliminated, then the downstream roughness causes no disturbance to the passage of a laminar layerie, the surface, though roughened, is aerodynamically smooth   moreover, it appears that the conditions defining the upstream boundary to this region of insignificant roughness are fundamentally the same as those which determine the critical state for transition at an artificial disturbance of a three dimensional character
