1213  heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow, including effects of yaw and nose bluntness   wittcliff,ce and wilson,mr  j ae scs 1962, 761  heat transfer to slender cones in hypersonic flow, including effects of yaw and nose bluntness    as part of a general study of the aerothermodynamic characteristics of flight of hypersonic vehicles, an investigation of laminar heat transfer to slender yawed cones has been conducted  experiments have been made in the cal 11 by 15in shock tunnel at mach numbers from 11 to 13 and at yaw angles up to were tested    the heattransfer rates are compared with theoretical predictions   the effects on the local heattransfer rates of the boundarylayer displacement thickness, transverse curvature, yaw, nose bluntness, and the entropy sublayer are discussed   it is shown that, at zero yaw, the experimental data for the sharp cone are in good agreement with theory when boundarylayer displacement and transversecurvature effects are included  for the yawed sharp cone, the heattransfer rates along the most windward streamline are in good agreement with reshotko theory for yaw angles up to 3   at larger yaw angles, the experimental heat transfer was found to be greater than that predicted theoretically   however, at these yaw angles the heattransfer distribution on the windward side was in good agreement with laminarboundarylayer calculations based on an assumption of local similarity   the zeroyaw tests of the blunted cones showed qualitative agreement with cheng shocklayer theory for slender bluntnose bodies
