608  aerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnels   laufer, j  j aero sc v 28, sept 1961   aerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnels  hotwire measurements in the free stream of a supersonic wind tunnel were made in the mach number range of 16 to 50  it is shown that the massflow fluctuations increase very rapidly with increasing mach number  if the fluctuation field is assumed to consist of sound wavesdash an assumption that is consistent with the measurementsdashthe sound intensity is approximately proportional to m, within the range of the experiments  furthermore, the orientation of the field is found to be different from the mach line direction, it corresponds to a soundsource velocity of approximately onehalf the freestream velocity for the higher mach numbers  it is shown that the turbulent boundary layer along the nozzle and the tunnel walls is responsible for this sound field
