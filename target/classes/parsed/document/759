759  stability investigation of a blunted cone and a blunted ogive with a flared cylinder afterbody at mach numbers from 0 30 to 2 85   coltrane,lc  nasa tnd1506, 1962  stability investigation of a blunted cone and a blunted ogive with a flared cylinder afterbody at mach numbers from 0 30 to 2 85    a cone with a blunt nose tip and a blunt nose tip and a 20 flared cylinder afterbody have been tested in free flight over a mach number range from 030 to 285 and a reynolds number range from 1 x 10 to 23 x 10   time histories, cross plots of force and moment coefficients, and plots of the longitudinalforce coefficient, rolling velocity, aerodynamic center, normalforcecurve slope, and dynamic stability are presented  with the centerofgravity location at about models were both statically and dynamically stable throughout the mach number range   for the cone, the average aerodynamic center moved slightly forward with decreasing speeds and the normalforcecurve slope was fairly constant throughout the speed range   for the ogive, the average aerodynamic center remained practically constant and the normalforcecurve slope remained practically constant to a mach number of approximately 16 where a rising trend was noted   maximum drag coefficient for the cone, with reference to the base area, was approximately 06, and for the ogive, with reference to the area of the cylindrical portion, was approximately 21
