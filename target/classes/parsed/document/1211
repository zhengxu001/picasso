1211  boundary layer transition at supersonic speedsthreedimensional roughness effects (spheres)  van driest,er and blumer,cb   boundary layer transition at supersonic speedsthreedimensional roughness effects (spheres)   further experiments carried out in the 12in supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of threedimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundarylayer transition on a the local mach number for these tests was 271   the data show clearly that the minimum (effective) size of trip required to bring transition to its lowest reynolds number varies as the onefourth power of the distance from the apex of the cone to the trip   use of available data for other mach numbers indicates that the machnumber influence for effective tripping is taken into account by the simple expression  some remarks concerning the roughness variation for transition on a blunt body are made
