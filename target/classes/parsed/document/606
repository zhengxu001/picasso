606  formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight   monaghan, rj  rae tn aero 2407   formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight  this note gives formulae and approximations suitable for making preliminary estimates of aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight  the formulae are based on the /intermediate enthalpy/ approximation which has given good agreement with theoretical and experimental evidence  in the general flight case they could be used in conjunction with  an analogue computer or a stepbystep method of integration to predict the variations of heat flow and skin temperature with time  in the restricted case of flight at constant altitude and mach number, simple analytical methods and results are given which include the effects of radiation and can be applied to /thick/ as well as /thin/ skins where h is the aerodynamic heat transfer factor, and g, d and k are the heat capacity, thickness and thermal conductivity of the skin  if 01 the skin is approximately /thin/, ie temperature gradients across its thickness may be neglected
