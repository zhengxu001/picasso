585  nonlinear heat transfer problem   chambre,pl  j app phys 30, 1959, 1683  nonlinear heat transfer problem    a study has been made of the timedependent heat conduction in a semiinfinite medium subject to a boundary condition which can involve the temperature in a nonlinear manner   a formulation for the determination of the surface temperature, which is often of greatest physical interest, leads to a nonlinear volterra integral equation   a simple iterative solution method, with an accuracy suitable for many practical purposes is presented   as an example, the problem of the timedependent surface temperature of a body receiving heat according to the stefanboltzmann law is treated   the analysis is also applicable to physical adsorption or chemisorption processes which occur at the boundary
