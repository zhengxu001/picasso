82  theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glasstype heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a reentering irbm   adams,ew  nasa tnd564, 1961  theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glasstype heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a reentering irbm    the meltingtype heat protection at the stagnation point of a reentering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of some effects due to variations of the glass properties   the ballistic reentry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0635 m, a ballistic factor of 35 x 10, a reentry angle of 1249 (from the vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a reentry speed of 45  the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions for the problem   as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight state are also given   the discussions made it possible to derive under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the employment of thin, or lightweight, glass shields    investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat, and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable   a small thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high radiative heat transfer out of the shield, and steep temperature profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across the shield with little total ablation of the shield   results show that for the assumed irbm reentry, the necessary thickness of the employed glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is the only material parameter affecting this thickness    a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable, although, these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely low viscosity level
