1274  real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds   nagamatsu, ht, geiger, re and sheer, re  j aero sc april, 1960 p241   real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds  a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable to those encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites reentering the atmosphere  some results for a shock velocity of over 50,000 ft per sec in the shock tube portion of the facility are presented  static pressure investigations were made in the nozzle to determine the flow condition and the expansion process  the results of the investigation of representative blunt bodies at hypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up to approximately 6,000degreek are presented  these include body pressure distributions, shockwave shapes, detachment distances, and photographs of the luminous gas region in the shock layer  it is seen that the shock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperatures due to the real gas effects  for the hemisphere the pressure distribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for  all stagnation temperatures  for a 50degree conehemisphere the pressure distribution and the shock detachment distance were appreciably affected by the real gas effects  the observed shockwave shape and the approximate boundary layer on a flat plate are compared with the analytical prediction  some preliminary results for the detached shock wave produced by a blunt two dimensional body in a low density flow at a mach number of 196 are presented
