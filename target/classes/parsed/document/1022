1022  note on creep buckling of columns     note on creep buckling of columns    fortythree cylinders of 40inch length and 16inch diameter, made of 50520 aluminumalloy sheets of thickness, were subjected to bending moments constant along the cylinder and in time in an oven which maintained a constant temperature of 500 f during the test   all the cylinders failed by buckling   the time that elapsed between load application and collapse was measured
