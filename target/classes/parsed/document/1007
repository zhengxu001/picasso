1007  freeflight measurements of the static and dynamic     freeflight measurements of the static and dynamic    this report presents equations, tables, and figures for use in the analysis of helium flow at supersonic and hypersonic speeds   the contents of the report and presentation of the data parallel that of a similar reference work (naca rep 1135) prepared for air flow    the perfectgas relations for continuous onedimensional flow, normal and obliqueshock waves, and prandtlmeyer expansions are the same as for air but are presented here for completeness   the tables present the values of useful dimensionless ratios for continuous onedimensional flow and for normalshock waves as functions of mach number   the helium viscosity relation as a function of temperature, massflow rates as a function of mach number and temperature, and the reynolds number as a function of mach number and stagnation temperature are plotted   the obliqueshock characteristics of wedges and cones in helium at mach numbers of 12, 16, 20, and 24 are presented in a series of plots   throughout all the computations, helium is considered to be a perfect gas
