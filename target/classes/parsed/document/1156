1156  experimental investigation of attenuation of strong shock waves in a shock tube with hydrogen and helium as driver gases   jones,jj  nasa tn4072, 1957  experimental investigation of attenuation of strong shock waves in a shock tube with hydrogen and helium as driver gases    an experimental investigation has been made of the attenuation of strong shock waves in air in a shock tube   timehistory measurements were made of the static pressure at several stations in the wall of the tube   the internal diameter of the tube is 375 inches   shock wavevelocity data were taken for a distance along the tube of about 120 feet  the range of the shockwave mach number covered was from 5 to 10 and the initial pressure ahead of the shock wave varied from 5 to 100 millimeters of mercury   hydrogen and helium were used as driver gases    a heliumdriven shock wave was found to decay only about onehalf as rapidly as a hydrogendriven shock wave  the pressure level had little effect on the attenuation rate of a shock wave of given strength for the pressure range investigated   the staticpressure measurements indicated that a severe pressure gradient existed in the latter portion of the air flow   this gradient limits the testing time useful for obtaining reliable aerodynamic data
