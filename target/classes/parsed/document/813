813  the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referred to a bodyaxis system   nelson,rl  naca tn3737, 1956  the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referred to a bodyaxis system    the linearized equations of motion have been derived for a rolling missile having slight aerodynamic asymmetries   time histories of rollingmissile motions referred to a bodyaxis system have been prepared to show the types of missile motions that can be encountered  the motions resulting from a trim change and a pulserocket disturbance are shown to be determined mainly by the ratio of rolling velocity to pitching frequency    finally, the derived equations are used in establishing a technique for the reduction of rollingmissile oscillation data   it is shown that the aerodynamic derivatives can be obtained from flight data if four accelerations are measured   the method is applied to the results obtained from a flight test of a missile configuration
