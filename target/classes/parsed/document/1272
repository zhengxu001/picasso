1272  oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory   rodden,wp and revell,jd  j ae scs 1960, 451  oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for a unified supersonic hypersonic strip theory    this investigation presents a derivation of the oscillatory aerodynamic coefficients for wings with supersonic leading edges from the secondorder, nonlinear, unsteady, supersonic flow theory of van dyke   the theory is considered applicable throughout the supersonichypersonic regime at mach numbers normal to the leading edge and reduced frequencies for which  the coefficients are modified for sweep, and a finitespan correction is suggested to increase the accuracy of striptheory flutter analyses   the limiting values of the coefficients in steady flow are also discussed
