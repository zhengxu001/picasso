425  the solution of elastic plate problems by electrical analogies   r h macneal,  pasadena, calif  the solution of elastic plate problems by electrical analogies  a dynamicanalogy method for the solution of elastic plate problems is described in this paper   the electrical circuits developed here can be setup and studied on an electricanalog computer   problems involving deflections under constant load, transient vibrations, or normal modes can be solved in this way   the method of applying boundary conditions to plates with irregular edges is given, together with a detailed description of the representation of the boundary conditions for a rectangular variablethickness plate   solutions that have been obtained on the cal tech electricanalog computer are presented for the static deflections and normal modes of a rectangular cantilever plate
