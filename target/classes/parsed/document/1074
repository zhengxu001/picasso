1074  theoretical and experimental investigation of secondorder supersonic wingbody interference   landahl, m, drougge, g and beane, bj  j aero sc v 27, september 1960 pp 694702   theoretical and experimental investigation of secondorder supersonic wingbody interference  approximate secondorder solutions for the supersonic flow around wingbody combinations are calculated, using two different theoretical models small and the wing sweep small in comparison with that of the mach cone are considered  the analysis is restricted to such high mach numbers that m2 1, and an approximate formula common to the two models is then found for the secondorder interference term  this formula can also be used to correct experimental pressure distributions for the effect of nonuniformities in the windtunnel flow  in order to test the theory, windtunnel experiments on nonlifting conecylinder bodies in combination with wings of simple shapes were performed  pressure distributions were measured at m 3 and m 4, both around the bodies and on the wings separately, as well as in combination, and it was found that the secondorder interference was predicted reasonably well by the simplified theory
