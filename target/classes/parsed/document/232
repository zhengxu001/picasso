232  accuracy of approximate methods for predicting pressure on pointed nonlifting bodies of revolution in supersonic flow   ehret,dm  naca tn2764  accuracy of approximate methods for predicting pressure on pointed nonlifting bodies of revolution in supersonic flow    the accuracy and range of applicability of the linearized theory, secondorder theory, tangentcone method, conicalshockexpansion theory and newtonian theory for predicting pressure distributions on pointed bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack are investigated   pressure distributions and integrated pressure drag obtained by these methods are compared with standard values obtained by the method of characteristics and the theory of taylor and maccoll  three shapes, cone, ogive, and a modified optimum body, are investigated over a wide range of fineness ratios and mach numbers    it is found that the linearized theory is accurate only at low values of the hypersonic similarity parameter number to body fineness ratio) and that secondorder theory appreciably extends the range of accurate application  the secondorder theory gives good results on ogives when the ratio of the tangent of maximum surface angle to the tangent of the mach angle is less than 09   tangentcone method cannot be widely applied with good accuracy   in general, the conicalshockexpansion theory predicts pressure and drag within engineering accuracy when the hypersonic similarity parameter is greater than 12  although newtonian theory gives good accuracy, except for cones, at the highest values of the hypersonic similarity parameter investigated, it is less accurate than the conicalshockexpansion theory
