1340  method of controlling stiffness properties of a solidconstruction model wing   land, ns and abbott, ft  naca tn 3423, 1955   method of controlling stiffness properties of a solidconstruction model wing  a simple method is presented for controlling the bending and torsional stiffnesses of a solidconstruction model wing  the method consists of weakening the wing by drilling holes through the wing normal to the chord plane  aerodynamic continuity is maintained by filling the holes with a relatively soft material  the important parameters controlling the stiffnesses are the amount of material removed by drilling, the ratio of hole diameter to wing thickness, and the planform pattern of the holes  data are given which may be used for predicting the stiffness of a model wing weakened in this manner
