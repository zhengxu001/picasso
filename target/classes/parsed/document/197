197  pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and including the transonic speed range   swihart,jm and whitcomb,cf  naca rm l53h04, 1953  pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and including the transonic speed range    this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in the langley 16foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range   the effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is also included    the models were tested through a mach number range from 060 to 109  the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x diameter was 13 x 10 to 453 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack    an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly   these effects were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 005 in the normalforce coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical crossflow reynolds number range   this increase is in agreement with theoretical approximations    a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the body    the effect of a change in stingcone angle from 5 to 9 on the pressure distribution of the 120inch model was negligible up to a mach number of 105   at this mach number the effect was to cause a small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body
