70  a study of flow changes associated with airfoil section drag rise at supercritical speeds   nitzburg,ge and crandall,s  naca tn1813, 1949  a study of flow changes associated with airfoil section drag rise at supercritical speeds    a study of experimental pressure distributions and section characteristics for several moderately thick airfoil sections was made   a correlation appears to exist between the dragdivergence mach number and the freestream mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest, the chordwise station at which the airfoil surface is tangent to the freestream direction   it was found that, since the mach number for which sonic velocity occurs at the airfoil crest can be estimated satisfactorily by means of the prandtlglauert rule, a method is provided whereby the dragdivergence mach number of an airfoil section at a given angle of attack can be estimated from the lowspeed pressure distribution and the airfoil profile   this method was used to predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy the dragdivergence mach number of a considerable number of airfoil sections having diverse shapes and a wide range of thicknesschord ratios    the pressure distributions and section force characteristics of several moderately thick airfoil sections at mach numbers above the dragdivergence mach number were analyzed   some of the characteristics of the flow over these airfoils at supercritical mach numbers are discussed
