638  longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonic speeds of a highly swept wing utilizing nose deflection for control   spencer,b  nasa tnd1482, 1962  longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonic speeds of a highly swept wing utilizing nose deflection for control    an investigation has been conducted in the langley 7 by 10foot transonic tunnel at low subsonic speeds to determine the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with deflection of the nose section of a highly swept delta wing having an aspect ratio of 133   in order to illustrate the effectiveness of this forward control, the longitudinal control characteristics are also presented for the wing with upperand lowersurface split flaps located at the trailing edge    comparison between the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the wing utilizing the nose control and those of the wing utilizing the uppersurface split flap located at the trailing edge indicated similar control effectiveness for high control deflections (15) and similar values of trimmed liftdrag ratio with increasing lift coefficient   use of the nose control, however, indicated a lower value of trimmed angle of attack for a given value of trimmed lift coefficient than that realized from use of the uppersurface split flap   further reductions in trimmed angle of attack for a given value of trimmed lift coefficient may be realized from deflection of the lowersurface split flap at the wing trailing edge in combination with the nose control and would be accompanied by large reductions in liftdrag ratio
