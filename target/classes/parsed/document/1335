1335  use of freon12 as a fluid for aerodynamic testing   huber,pw  naca tn1024, 1946  use of freon12 as a fluid for aerodynamic testing    the thermodynamic properties of freon12 have been investigated to determine the possibilities of the use of this gas as a fluid for aerodynamic testing   the values of velocity of sound in freon12, which are less than onehalf those in air, are presented as functions of temperatures and pressure, including measurements at room temperature   the density of freon12 is about four times that of air   changes in state of freon12 may be predicted by means of the ideal gas law with an accuracy of better than 1 percent at pressures below freon12 is shown not to condense during an adiabatic expansion from normal conditions up to a mach number of 3   the values of the ratio of specific heats for freon12 are lower than that for air, and therefore an additional parameter is introduced, which must be considered when comparisons are made of aerodynamic tests using freon12 with those using air    the time lag of the vibrational heat capacity of freon12 to a change in temperature has been measured and found to be of the order of 2 x 10 second at atmospheric temperature and pressure   this time is so short that no important energy dissipations should result in most engineering applications
