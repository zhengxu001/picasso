526  leading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminar or turbulent boundary layers   mabey,dg  j ae scs 29, 1962  leading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminar or turbulent boundary layers    the transonic flow round a twodimensional airfoil at incidence is often determined by the type of flow in the leadingedge region   if the flow separates at the leading edge at low speeds it is liable to attach as the speed increases, often quite suddenly  a review of this change with laminar or with turbulent boundary layers reemphasizes the importance of fixing transition when making model tests at transonic speeds in order to obtain flows closest to fullscale conditions    it is shown that similar airfoils with attached leadingedge flow show transonic similarity upstream of the terminal shock
