4  approximate solutions of the incompressible laminar boundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow   yen,kt  j ae scs 22, 1955, 728  approximate solutions of the incompressible laminar boundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow    the twodimensional steady boundarylayer problem for a flat plate in a shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered  solutions for the boundary layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocity distribution in the boundary layer are obtained by the karmanpohlhausen technique   comparison with the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also been made to show the effect of vorticity
