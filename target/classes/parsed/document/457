457  on laminar boundarylayer flow near a position of separation   goldstein,s  q j mechapp mech 1, 1948, 43  on laminar boundarylayer flow near a position of separation    singularities are considered in the solution of the laminar boundarylayer equations at a position of separation   a singularity of the type here considered occurred in a careful numerical computation by hartree for a linearly decreasing velocity distribution outside the boundary layer , it may occur generally   whenever it does occur, the boundarylayer equations cease to be valid at and near separation on the upstream side, and also downstream of separation  the work suggests that singularities may arise in the solution of nonlinear parabolic equations due to their nonlinearity   the formulae found may help computers of laminar boundary layers, who desire more than a rough solution, to have an endpoint at which to aim
