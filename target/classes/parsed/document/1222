1222  axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow   hains,fd and holer,ya  j ae scs 1962, 143  axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow    the axisymmetric subsonic and supersonic flow fields, and the skin friction and heat transfer of an electrically conducting compressible fluid flowing in a channel of constant circular area through a magnetic field are investigated when the magnetic reynolds number is small   the inviscidflow field for flow through a dipole field is solved by the method of characteristics in the supersonic case   for the subsonic case, linearized equations are derived for small values of the magnetic interaction parameter   numerical results are obtained by the relaxation method    the inviscidflowfield solutions are used as boundary conditions for the laminar boundary layer along the wall, in which axial pressure gradients form an important feature   the exact continuumflow equations are reduced by an orderofmagnitude analysis to the boundarylayer equations, which are solved numerically by an integral method using a fourthdegree velocity profile and a fifthdegree stagnationenthalpy profile    pressure, temperature, and heattransfer measurements are made with a shock tube under supersonicflow conditions closely approaching those used in the numerical computations  general agreement is found between the theoretical and the experimental results
