1366  the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and arbitrary pressure gradient   cohen,cb and reshotko,e  naca r1294, 1956  the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and arbitrary pressure gradient    an approximate method for the calculation of the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and arbitrary pressure gradient, based on thwaites' correlation concept, is presented   the method results from the application of stewartson transformation to prandtl equations, which yeilds a nonlinear set of two firstorder differential equations  these equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters related to the wall shear, the surface heat transfer, and the transformed freestream velocity   thwaites' concept of the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumed  the evaluation of these quantities is then carried out by utilizing exact solutions recently obtained    with the resulting relations, methods are derived for the calculation of the twodimensional and axially symmetric laminar boundary layer with arbitrary freestream velocity distribution   mach number, and surface temperature level    the combined effect of heat transfer and pressure gradient is demonstrated by applying the method to calculate the characteristics of the boundary layer on thin supersonic surfaces and in a highly cooled, convergentdivergent, axially symmetric rocket nozzle
