416  methods of boundarylayer control for postponing and alleviating buffeting and other effects of shockinduced separation   pearcey, hh and stuart, cm  smf fund paper, no ff dash 22, 1959   methods of boundarylayer control for postponing and alleviating buffeting and other effects of shockinduced separation  the use of boundarylayer control to increase the separationfree margins of mach number and lift coefficient beyond the cruise point of highspeed aircraft may often be preferred to design changes that impair  the cruising performance or the landing and takeoff characteristics  the factors that influence the choice of method and details of its application are discussed, emphasising particularly the need to maintain effectiveness over most of the chord to cover the wide range of separation positions encountered as the shock moves over the wing with changing flight conditions  research at the national physical laboratory that has embraced highvelocity blowing, vane and airjet vortex generators, and, in a preliminary way, distributed suction, is briefly described  the relative merits of the various methods are discussed, and some results achieved in their application are given  for vortex generators, the importance is stressed of the vortex paths determined by the interactions of neighbouring vortices and their images  thus, systems of counterrotating vortices always leave the surface in pairs and lose their effectiveness  corotating systems are therefore preferred for many applications  blowing, which in windtunnel tests gives results as good as or better than vortex generators and does not have the disadvantage of a drag penalty at cruise, has not yet been assessed in flight  airjet vortex generators, which would also avoid the drag penalty, show promise of producing significant effects with relatively small blowing pressures and quantities
