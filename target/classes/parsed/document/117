117  the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid   mather,dj  qjmechappmath 14, 1961, 423  the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid    an approximate solution for the steady flow of incompressible viscous liquid past a paraboloid of revolution is described  an assumption is made for the form of the stokes stream function and substituted into the navierstokes equations using paraboloidal coordinates   after making suitable approximations, a nonlinear differential equation for a function f is deduced   the solutions of this equation depend on the reynolds number of the flow considered   examples found by numerical integration are given to illustrate the properties of the function f for reynolds numbers varying from 00001 to is found, and it is shown that this approximate solution tends to the perfect fluid flow away from the boundary, allowance being made for the displacement effect of what may be called the boundary layer
