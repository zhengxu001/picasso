1228  leadingedge separation of laminar boundary layers in supersonic flow   brower,wb  j ae scs 1961, 957  leadingedge separation of laminar boundary layers in supersonic flow    a brief description of the flow field is given for the interaction of shock wave and laminar boundary layer on a compression corner in supersonic flow   a special subcasethat of leadingedge laminar separationis analyzed by extension of chapman laminar mixinglayer theory   results are tabulated for ranges of mach number, and compressioncorner angle  a limited region of possible leadingedge laminar separation with an attached leadingedge shock (or in certain cases an expansion) followed by a second shock due to the reattachment flow is found to exist   comparison with existing experimental data is found to be satisfactory in several cases
