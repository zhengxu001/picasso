239  design and calibration at low speeds of a static tube and a pitotstatic tube with semiellipsoidal nose shapes   kettle,dj  rae tnaero2247, 1953  design and calibration at low speeds of a static tube and a pitotstatic tube with semiellipsoidal nose shapes    a new static tube and a new pitotstatic tube have been designed and calibrated in the no1 and the no2 11 ft x 8 ft wind tunnels of the rae, using a long static tube, the error of which is believed to be very small, as a standard for comparison    the results show that the static pressure measured by these tubes is in error due to the supporting strut and to the nose shape of the tube by an amount which may be calculated for positions of the static slot, or holes, greater than 10 tube diameters ahead of the strut   the readings show no measurable scale effect in the speed range 100230 ft sec   the static tube is insensitive to yaw in the range 1 with a squareedged slot and is even less sensitive to yaw when the slot edges are rounded   the turbulence of the tunnel has an effect on the static pressure reading
