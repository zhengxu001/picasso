1260  on the response of the laminar boundary layer to small fluctuations of the freestream velocity   rott,n and rosenzweig,ml  j ae scs 1960, 741  on the response of the laminar boundary layer to small fluctuations of the freestream velocity    the linearized treatment of small timedependent disturbances of a laminar boundary layer, initiated by lighthill, is extended in several ways   in particular, the highfrequency expansion is continued beyond the leading (stokes) term   several interesting questions of /joining/ occur, which are discussed but left unresolved   in addition, a practical method for obtaining the response to the laminar boundary layer to an impulsive change in velocity is presented   the methods are applied to the case in which the basic steady flow belongs to the falkner and skan family of similarity solutions
