624  cruise performance of channelflow ground effect machines   strand,t  j ae scs 29, 1962, 702  cruise performance of channelflow ground effect machines    the performance theory for highspeed aircushion vehicles operating in close proximity to the ground is developed   the analysis is restricted to cruise flight of vehicles of rectangular planform employing an air pressure seal between the ground and the vehicle along the two streamwise sides   the variation of the optimum rearward deflection angle of the side jet pressure seal with speed for minimum overall power expenditure and maximum range is found   it is concluded that a mixed propulsion system (jet deflection plus propeller(s)) is required  volume flow and the corresponding fan pressure rise needed are also calculated   the maximum lift drag ratio is determined    the maximum thickness ratios of the vehicles are considered to be large compared with the groundheight vehiclelength ratio   twodimensional airfoil theory is employed to show that close to stagnation conditions exist below the vehicles   the lowersurface lift, pitching moment, and aerodynamiccenter location are determined    the flow over the upper surface is identified with flow over mounds   uppersurface lift coefficients are determined for typical mound shapes    it is shown that high total lift coefficients are theoretically obtainable with almost zero induced drag   the conventional induceddrag power penalty is replaced by a sealingair power expenditure, which is shown not to be excessive
