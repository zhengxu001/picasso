680  generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory   lomax, h and heaslett, ma  naca tn 2497, september 1951   generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory  linearized, compressibleflow analysis is applied to the study of quasiconical supersonic wing theory  singleintegral equations are derived which relate either the loading to the shape of a lifting surface or the thickness of a symmetrical wing to the pressure distribution for triangular wings with subsonic leading edges  the forms of these equations and their inversions are simplified through the introduction of the finite part and the generalized principal part of an integral  applications of the theory, in the lifting case, include previously known results  in the nonlifting case, it is shown that for a specified  pressure distribution the theory does not always predict a unique thickness distribution  this is demonstrated for a triangular plan form  having a constant pressure gradient in the stream direction
