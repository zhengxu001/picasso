1296  nonequilibrium expansions of air with coupled chemical reactions   eschenroeder,aq, boyer,d and hall,jg  phys fluids, 1962  nonequilibrium expansions of air with coupled chemical reactions    analysis and solutions of the streamtube gas dynamics involving coupled chemical rate equations are carried out   results are presented for airflows along the surface of blunt bodies and through hypersonic nozzles   speeds and altitudes corresponding to reentry were selected to obtain initial conditions for the external flow calculations   conditions appropriate to hypersonic tunnel testing were chosen for the nozzle flow calculations   composition histories are shown for a kinetic mechanism including 6 species and 14 reactions   gasdynamic effects of nonequilibrium processes qualitatively resemble those reported earlier   however, the freezing process is complicated by the coupling of the nitric oxide shuffle reactions with the dissociationrecombination reactions   in many cases of hypersonic nozzle flows where the energy in nitrogen dissociation is significant, the fast shuffle reactions prevent nitrogenatom freezing which would otherwise occur if threebody recombination were the only process operating   nitric oxide concentrations undershoot the equilibrium values if the ratio of nitric oxide to oxygen molecule concentrations exceeds unity in the freezing region   this depletion of nitric oxide leads to nitrogenatom freezing
