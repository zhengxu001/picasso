380  effect of quasisteady air forces on incompressible bendingtorsion flutter   dugundi,j  j ae scs 1958  effect of quasisteady air forces on incompressible bendingtorsion flutter    explicit solutions are obtained for the bendingtorsion flutter of a twodimensional airfoil in incompressible flow under the assumptions that the theodorsen function, c(k) is set equal to a real constant, and the diagonal virtual mass terms are negligible  for the case of small bending to torsion frequency ratio, a comparison is made of these quasisteady solutions with an earlier empirical expression suggested by theodorsen and garrick for the nonsteady case, and the effect of the c(k) function is indicated   the importance of the cg location for these small cases is reemphasized, and the possibility of flutter at zero air speed is indicated
