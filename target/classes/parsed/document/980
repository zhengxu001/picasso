980  a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from arbitrary variation of adiabaticwall temperature and heattransfer coefficient   hills, pr  naca report 1372, 1958   a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from arbitrary variation of adiabaticwall temperature and heattransfer coefficient  a method of calculating the temperature of thick walls has been developed in which are used relatively new concepts, such as the time series and the response to a unit triangle variation of surface temperature, together with essentially standard formulas for transient temperature and heat flow into thick walls  the method can be used without knowledge of the mathematical tools of its development  the method is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature in onedimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there is a continuous variation of the heattransfer coefficient and adiabaticwall temperature  the method also offers a convenient means for solving the inverse problem of determining the heatflow history when temperature history is known  a series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as well as by the new method  a comparison of the results shows the new method to be accurate  the labor involved is very modest in consideration of the nature of the thickwall temperature problem  limiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for walls so thin that thermal lag can be neglected were also obtained
