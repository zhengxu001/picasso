413  turbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynolds numbers in air and helium  nasa r82, 1960   matting,fw, chapman,dr, nyholm,jr and thomas,ag  naca r847, 1946  turbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynolds numbers in air and helium  nasa r82, 1960    results are given of local skinfriction measurements in turbulent boundary layers over an equivalent air mach number range from 02 to 99 and an overall reynolds number variation of 2x10 to 100x10   direct force measurements were made by means of a floating element   flows were twodimensional over a smooth flat surface with essentially zero pressure gradient and with adiabatic conditions at the wall   air and helium were used as working fluids   an equivalence parameter for comparing boundary layers in different working fluids is derived and the experimental verification of the parameter is demonstrated  experimental results are compared with the results obtained by several methods of calculating skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer
