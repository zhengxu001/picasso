505  transition measurements on cones in free flight ballistics range tests   lyons,wc  j ae scs 29, 1962, 352  transition measurements on cones in free flight ballistics range tests    navysponsored experimental investigation of the location of boundarylayer transition on sharpnosed cones having 10 total angles   the ambient temperature in a portion of the aeroballistics range is varied so as to obtain different adiabatic recovery temperatures at a constant nominal mach number of 31   the location of transition is expressed as a transition reynolds number, and results are presented graphically as a function of the ratio between the wall temperature and the adiabatic recovery temperature
