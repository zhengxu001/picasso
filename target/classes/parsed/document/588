588  compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled    naca rm e56b03b, 1956  chapter xiii  compressor operation with one or more blade rows stalled  an analysis of the partspeed operating problems of highpressureratio ratio multistage axialflow compressors was made by means of a simplified stagestacking study   the principal problems considered were poor lowspeed efficiency, multiplevalued performance characteristics at intermediate speeds, and poor intermediatespeed compressor surge or stalllimit characteristics  the analysis indicated that all these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics of the front stages  such discontinuities can be due to the type of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance resulting from stall of adjacent stages    the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor partspeed operation were also considered  this phase of the study indicated that such compromises would severly reduce the completecompressorstall margin  furthermore, the lowspeed stage stall problem is transferred from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to abruptstall characteristics    the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to partspeed compressor performance  these characteristics must, however, be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the multistage compressor  alleviation of partspeed operation problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage loading margin    the results of this analysis are only qualitative  the trends obtained, however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies of highpressureratio multistage axialflow compressors, and the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the offdesign problem  in addition to these stagematching studies, a general discussion of variablegeometry features such as air bleed and adjustable blades is included
