349  numerical solution of the boundary layer equations without similarity assumptions   kramer,rf and lieberstein,h  j ae scs 26, 1959, 508  numerical solution of the boundary layer equations without similarity assumptions    the crocco transformation combined with a mangler transformation is used to carry the boundarylayer problem for axially symmetric blunt bodies into a form suitable for direct numerical computation without introduction of similarity assumptions  conditions which in the original problem appear at infinity now are brought to a finite straight line, and the body is transformed to a parallel line   data can be generated on the stagnation line the equations are a parabolic system of two secondorder equations, the boundaryvalue problem is analogous to the slab problem for the heat equation   an implicit difference equation is used to reduce stability difficulties   special techniques in forming the difference equation result in a linear system of algebraic equations to be solved on any given line of integration, and these solutions are computed from recursion relations generated by back substitution   for bluntnosed bodies with approach flow mach numbers greater than 8 (approximately), large temperature gradients occur across a thin boundary layer of dissociated gas, and it is necessary to use realgas effects, approximated here by certain fits to the gas tables   a case is computed, however, for a lower mach number approach flow using perfectgas theory to provide a standard against which similarity solutions may be tested
