464  flow studies on flat plate delta wings at supersonic speeds   michael,wh  naca tn3472, 1955  flow studies on flat plate delta wings at supersonic speeds    an experimental study has been made to investigate some aspects of the nature of the flow around delta wings   vaporscreen, pressuredistribution, and inkflow studies were made at a mach number of 19 on a series of semispan deltawing models with slender wedge airfoil sections and very sharp leading edges   the models had semiapex angles ranging from 5 to 3175    separated regions of vorticity existed along the chords of all the wings in the series tested   concentrated vortex cores were found only on wings of very small semiapex angles   for wings with medium and large semiapex angles, the separated vorticity was concentrated in a region extending over the outboard part of the span and lying close to the wing upper surface    the results show that theoretical aerodynamic calculations, such as those in naca tn 3430, utilizing a single, separated vortex pair above the wing upper surface to represent the separated vorticity can be applied at supersonic speeds for very slender wings
