833  a simple method of matric structural analysis, part iv, nonlinear problems   klein,b  j ae scs 26, 1959  a simple method of matric structural analysis, part iv, nonlinear problems    the method presented in the previous parts is employed to solve various kinds of nonlinear problems, such as problems concerning large deflections or buckling, or thermal creep, or inelastic stress redistribution involving thermal gradients, or design   the procedure used in each case is one of direct iterationi e, after one assumes a starting point all subsequent cycles are selfgenerating   simple numerical examples are worked out
