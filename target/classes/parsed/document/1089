1089  aerodynamic characteristics of propellerdriven vtol aircraft   kirby,rh  nasa tnd730, 1961  aerodynamic characteristics of propellerdriven vtol aircraft    this paper discusses the two major configurations that are usually considered for achieving vtol while keeping the fuselage essentially horizontal  that is, the tiltwing and the deflectedslipstream configurations    because of the high turning losses incurred by deflectedslipstream configurations in hovering and because of the wingstalling problem of the pure tiltwing configurations during the transition, it appears that a combination of the two principles should be used   this tiltwing and flap configuration should make use of a programed extensiblechord slotted flap together with a leadingedge highlift device in order to avoid the performance and handling qualities problems associated with wing stalling during the transition while keeping the wing area as low as possible for efficiency in cruising flight
