1258  heat transfer, recovery factor and pressure distributions around a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefied air stream   tewfik,ok and giedt,wh  j ae scs 1960, 721  heat transfer, recovery factor and pressure distributions around a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefied air stream    measurements of the heat transfer, recovery factor, and pressure distributions around a circular cylinder normal to a supersonic rarefiedair stream (total temperature 300 k) are described for the mach number range of 13 to 57, the reynolds number range of 37 to 4,100 and at cylinder wall average temperature levels of 90 k and 210 k   study of the results yielded   (1) a correlation equation for the stagnationpoint nusselt number as a function of the reynolds number just after the normal part of the detached bow shock wave, and (2) fourier series expressions for the heattransfer coefficient and pressure coefficient distributions in terms of the stagnation point values    in comparing these measurements with predictions based on recent analytical studies, exceptionally good agreement for the heattransfer coefficient distribution was obtained with lees' theory   in the mach number range of 355 to 573 the pressure decreased less rapidly with distance from the stagnation point than predicted by the modified newtonian theory
