1225  the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics of turbulent boundary layers in supersonic streams   george h mclafferty and robert e barber  united aircraft corporation research laboratories  the effect of adverse pressure gradients on the characteristics of turbulent boundary layers in supersonic streams  tests were conducted at mach numbers from 20 to 35 to determine the thickness and profile shape characteristics of turbulent boundary layers on twodimensional and axisymmetric curvedsurface models having adverse pressure gradients   the magnitude of the gradients relative to the boundarylayer thickness at the beginning of the gradient was varied by employing models having different radii of curvature and by changing the boundarylayer thickness at the beginning of the gradient   the overall pressure rise in most cases was greater than the value which would cause a turbulent boundary layer to separate if the pressure rise were created by an oblique shock wave  an analytical investigation was also conducted so that the results of the experimental investigation could be applied to the prediction of cases outside the range of the experiments  it is shown that boundarylayer momentum thickness can be predicted from the von karman boundarylayer momentum equation, but that measured values of boundarylayer profile shape are in poor agreement with values computed from procedures derived by extending conventional methods for predicting profile shape in subsonic flow   a new procedure for calculating boundarylayer profile shapes, developed in this paper, is shown to provide a good correlation between experimental and calculated values of boundarylayer profile shapes in adverse pressure gradients created by curved surfaces   this procedure is based on the experimental observation that the station at which highenergy freestream flow actually mixes into a turbulent boundary layer in an adverse pressure gradient is well downstream of the station at which flow would have to mix in order to maintain a flatplate profile
