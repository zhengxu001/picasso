971  surface pressure distributions with a sonic jet normal to adjacent flat surfaces at mach 292 to 64   cubbison, rw, anderson, bh and ward, jj  nasa tn d580, february 1961   surface pressure distributions with a sonic jet normal to adjacent flat surfaces at mach 292 to 64  an investigation was made to determine the interference effects on surface pressure distributions caused by a sonic jet exiting normal to the surface  two configurations, a flat plate and an arrowwing reentrytype vehicle, with sonic nozzles near the leading edge were tested over a range of pressure ratios and reynolds numbers for mach numbers from the data indicate that jet pressure ratio had considerable effect on the  pressure levels and distributions on both configurations  also, for a constant jet pressure ratio, the freestream mach number effect on the distributions and levels was quite large  over the limited range investigated, the effect of reynolds number at constant mach number and pressure ratio was small compared to the mach number and pressure ratio effect
