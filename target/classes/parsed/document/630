630  stagnation region in rarefied high mach number flow   cheng,hk and chang,al  aiaa j 1963, 231  stagnation region in rarefied high mach number flow    paper describes results of numerical solution of the viscous shocklayer equations for axisymmetric stagnation region, using the viscositytemperature law with w=065, pr=071 and y=125   purpose is to establish applicability of the simple approximation of w=1 (obtained earlier) to air at low reynolds numbers and low ratios of wall temperature to stagnation temperature   using a reference temperature (closely equal to eckert) to interpret the linear results, excellent agreement is found, in the limit of, over a wide range of reynolds numbers, covering fully merged shock layers as well as boundary layers with and without vorticity interaction   agreement with recent experiments of ferri et al is as good as to be expected from shocklayer approximation   paper provides valuable extension of the applicability of the reference temperature concept
