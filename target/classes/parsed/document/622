622  scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satellite orbits   kinghele, dg and hughes, km  rae tn space 4, 1962   scale height in the upper atmosphere, derived from changes in satellite orbits  the'density scale height'h in the upper atmosphere is a measure of the rate at which air density p varies with height y, being given by hp//dp/dy/  the value of h, although important because/with the molecular weight of the air/it determines the air temperature, has not as yet been well determined at heights above 200 km  this note develops methods for finding h from the decrease in a satellite perigee height and from the decrease in the orbital period of a satellite in a smalleccentricity orbit  these methods are then applied to all the 14 satellites found suitable for the purpose  the 44  values of h obtained, for heights of 200450 km, represent an average over day and night and probably have errors/sd/of 510(  it is found that, as solar activity declined between 1957 and 1961, h decreased greatly egat height 275 km, h decreased from 60 km in early 1958 to height becomes much less rapid above 350 km, and are consistent with the  supposition that h had low values, near 35 km, at heights near 250 km, for 195961  the results could be greatly extended in scope and improved in accuracy if more accurate orbits were available for shortlifetime satellites
