143  interplanetary orbits   vertregt,m  jbritinters 16, 1958, 326  interplanetary orbits    the basic equations under simplified conditions for interplanetary flight are derived  for a voyage from planet to planet an unlimited number of orbits is possible   in order to give a clear survey of these possible orbits a diagram is developed from which the approximate energyrequirement, the duration, and other particulars of a voyage can be easily found
