198  investigation of a systematic group of naca 1  series cowlings with and without spinners   nichols,mr and keith,al  naca r950, 1949  investigation of a systematic group of naca 1  series cowlings with and without spinners    an investigation has been conducted in the langley propellerresearch tunnel to study cowlingspinner combinations based on the naca 1series nose inlets and to obtain systematic design data for one family of approximately ellipsoidal spinners  in the main part of the investigation, 11 of the related spinners were tested in various combinations with 9 naca opennose cowlings, which were also tested without spinners   the effects of location and shape of the spinner, shape of the inner surface of the cowling lip, and operation of a propeller having approximately oval shanks were investigated briefly   in addition, a study was conducted to determine the correct procedure for extrapolating design conditions determined from the lowspeed test data to the design conditions at the actual flight mach number    the design conditions for the naca 1series cowlings and cowlingspinner combinations are presented in the form of charts from which, for wide ranges of spinner proportions and rates of internal flow, cowlings with nearmaximum pressure recovery can be selected for critical mach numbers ranging from spinners and the effects of the spinners and the propeller on the cowling design conditions are presented separately to provide initial quantitative data for use in a general design procedure through which naca 1series cowlings can be selected for use with spinners of other shapes   by use of this general design procedure, correlation curves established from the test data, and derived compressibleflow equations relating the inletvelocity ratio to the surface pressures on the cowling and spinner, naca 1series cowlings and cowlingspinner combinations can be designed for critical mach numbers as high as 090
