182  effect of roughness on transition in supersonic flow   van driest,er and blumer,cb  agard r255, 1960  effect of roughness on transition in supersonic flow    further experiments carried out in the 12inch supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology to investigate the effect of threedimensional roughness elements (spheres) on boundarylayer transition on a 10 transfer are reported herein   the local mach number for these tests was minimum (effective) size of trip required to bring transition to its lowest reynolds number varies as the onefourth power of the distance from the apex of the cone to the trip  use of available data at other mach numbers indicates that the mach number influence for effective tripping is taken into account by the simple expression
