432  theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment due to differential wing incidence for slender cruciform wings and wingbody combinations   adams,gj and dugan,dw  naca r1088, 1952  theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment due to differential wing incidence for slender cruciform wings and wingbody combinations    a method of analysis based on slenderwing theory is developed to investigate the characteristics in roll of slender cruciform wings and wingbody combinations   the method makes use of the conformal mapping processes of classical hydrodynamics which transform the region outside a circle and the region outside an arbitrary arrangement of line segments intersecting at the origin   the method of analysis may be utilized to solve other slender cruciform wingbody problems involving arbitrarily assigned boundary conditions    in the present report, the application of the method has shown  differential incidence of both pairs of opposite surfaces of the cruciform wingbody combinations are practically independent of the bodydiametermaximumspan ratio up to a value of this ratio of 03  arrangement is only 62 percent greater than that for a corresponding planar wingbody combination  dence of both pairs of the opposing surfaces of the cruciform wingbody arrangement, is only 52 percent greater than that for a corresponding planar wingbody combination  unit surface deflection) of the cruciform wingbody arrangement having four equally deflected panels is therefore 94 percent of the corresponding planar wingbody combination
