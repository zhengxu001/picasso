431  freeflight measurements of the zerolift drag and base pressure on a wind tunnel interference model (m=0  8  1 5)   greenwood,gh  rae tnaero2725, 1960  freeflight measurements of the zerolift drag and base pressure on a wind tunnel interference model (m=0  8  1 5)    five freeflight models were flown to measure the zerolift drag and body base pressure on a standard wind tunnel interference model over a mach number range of 084 to 148    roughness bands on the wings and body of the model are shown to produce a small but definite increase in the zerolift drag at all mach numbers    the measured drag is in fair agreement with corresponding measurements made in various transonic tunnels with differences that could plausibly be explained as the effects of tunnel interference    the effect of a simulated wind tunnel support sting is shown to increase the base pressure   the discrepancy between models with and without a sting is greatest at subsonic speeds and progressively decreases with increasing mach number until at m = 14 the sting has no effect on base pressure
