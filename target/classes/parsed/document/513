513  pressure measurements at supersonic speeds on three uncambered conical wings of unit aspect ratio   britton,jw  rae tnaero2821, 1962  pressure measurements at supersonic speeds on three uncambered conical wings of unit aspect ratio    pressure measurements were made at mach numbers between 13 and 28 over a range of incidences on three simple models representing thick conical uncambered wings with sharp leading edges   these tests form part of an investigation into the effects of thickness and camber on slender wings    the aspect ratio of the models was unity in each case, and the spanwise cross sections were bounded by   the measured pressure distributions are presented, along with overall lift and drag (excluding skin friction and base drag) obtained by integration
