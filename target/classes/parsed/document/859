859  flutter of aerodynamically heated aluminiumalloy and stainless steel panels with lengthwidth ratio of 10 at mach 3 0  guy,ld and bohon,hl  nasa tnd1353, 1962  flutter of aerodynamically heated aluminiumalloy and stainless steel panels with lengthwidth ratio of 10 at mach 3 0   an investigation of the effects of aerodynamic heating on the flutter of multibay externalskin panels has been carried out at a mach number of 30 in the langley 9 by 6foot thermal structures tunnel   both aluminumalloy and 177 ph stainlesssteel panels with a lengthwidth ratio of 10 for each bay were tested at dynamic pressures between addition, a few tests were made on the lower vertical stabilizer of the x15 airplane which has externalskin panels unsupported for a length   all panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by an increase in panel thickness required to prevent flutter with increasing thermally induced stress prior to buckling   after buckling the panels showed flutter boundaries characterized by a decrease in thickness required to prevent flutter with further increases in thermal stress   the largest thickness required to prevent flutter in the presence of aerodynamic heating occurred at the transition between the flatpanel boundary and the buckledpanel boundary   this peak value (for aluminumalloy panel) was as much as 60 percent greater than the extrapolated value for an unheated, unloaded panel    values of the modifiedthicknessratio flutter parameter for the unstressed panels (obtained by extrapolation) were in fair agreement for the aluminum, steel, and x15 stabilizer panels   peak values at transition, however, showed large differences due to apparently minor changes in panelsupport construction and or changes in panelskin material
