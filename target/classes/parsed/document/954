954  analysis of stress at several junctions in pressurized shells   johns,rh, morgan,wc and spera,da  aiaa jnl 1, 1963, 455  analysis of stress at several junctions in pressurized shells    theoretical and experimental results are presented for the discontinuity stresses arising at a change of wall thickness in a cylinder, a cylinderhemisphere junction, and a conespherical torus junction in pressure vessels   the effect of mismatch of nonconcurrence of the middle surfaces of two joined cylinders is considered   in addition, a cylinder with a special closure which has considerably reduced stresses is described, and curves with theoretical and experimental stresses are presented
