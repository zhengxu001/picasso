994  investigation of a retrocket exhausting from the nose of a blunt body into a supersonic free stream   charczenko, n and hennessy, kw  nasa tn d1016, 1962   investigation of a retrocket exhausting from the nose of a blunt body into a supersonic free stream  the pressure distribution and pressure drag of a blunt body with a supersonic jet issuing upstream from its center were determined at freestream mach numbers of 160, 200, and 285  the thrust of the jet  issuing from the model nose was varied to study its effects on flow around the model and to determine variation of pressure distribution and  pressure drag of the model with the thrust  at all mach numbers investigated, the pressure drag decreased with increasing retrorocket thrust until a minimum value was reached  further increases in retrorocket thrust resulted in increases in the pressure drag  the resultant drag /pressure drag plus retrorocket thrust but excluding base and skinfriction drag/ of the model was reduced by retrorocket operation below the drag for a jetoff condition,  except at very low retrorocket thrust coefficients  the flow about the  nose of the blunt body was very unstable throughout the range of mach numbers and retrorocket thrust coefficients investigated
