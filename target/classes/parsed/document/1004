1004  freeflight measurements of the static and dynamic     freeflight measurements of the static and dynamic    the effects of contamination of helium by air upon staticpressure, totalpressure, heattransfer, and temperature measurements have been investigated in the 2inch helium tunnel at the langley research center   within the scope of the tests, even a small amount of air is shown to affect these measurements   the heattransfer and temperature measurements were made on a 266 halfangle cone and demonstrated the effects of contamination qualitatively   the wall static and centerline pitot pressures show that if the contaminating air is held to less than about 02 percent by volume, the error in indicated mach number is less than 1 percent as calculated from the rayleigh pitot equation  the corresponding errors in wall static and centerline pitot pressures are about 17 and 04 percent, respectively
