9  transition studies and skin friction measurements on an insulated flat plate at a mach number of 58   korkegi,rh  j ae scs 23, 1956, 97  transition studies and skin friction measurements on an insulated flat plate at a mach number of 58    an investigation of transition and skin friction on an insulated flat plate, 5 by 26 in, was made in the galcit 5 by 5 in hypersonic wind tunnel at a nominal mach number of 58    the phosphorescent lacquer technique was used for transition detection and was found to be in good agreement with totalhead rake measurements along the plate surface and pitot boundary layer surveys   it was found that the boundary layer was laminar at reynolds numbers of at least 5 x 10   transverse contamination caused by the turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel sidewall originated far downstream of the flat plate leading edge at reynolds numbers of 15 to 2 x 10, and spread at a uniform angle of 5 compared to 9 degree in lowspeed flow    the effect of twodimensional and local disturbances was investigated   the technique of air injection into the boundary layer as a means of hastening transition was extensively used  although the onset of transition occurred at reynolds numbers as low as 10, a fully developed turbulent boundary layer was not obtained at reynolds numbers much below 2 x 10 regardless of the amount of air injected    a qualitative discussion of these results is given with emphasis on the possibility of a greater stability of the laminar boundary layer in hypersonic flow than at lower speeds    direct skinfriction measurements were made by means of the floating element technique, over a range of reynolds numbers verified as being laminar over the complete range   with air injection, turbulent shear was obtained only for reynolds numbers greater than 2 x 10, this value being in good agreement with earlier results of this investigation   the turbulent skinfriction coefficient was found to be approximately 040 of that for incompressible flow for a constant value of r, and 046 for an effective reynolds number between 5 and 6 x 10
