1141  the wake behind an oscillating vehicle   zeisberg,sl  j ae scs 29, 1962, 1344  the wake behind an oscillating vehicle    the incompressible laminar far wake behind an oscillating vehicle is analyzed with the use of the oseen linearization, and the assumption that the wake cross section is axisymmetric  timewise drag variations are thus represented as changes in the wake diameter and velocity defect   it is shown that the unsteadiness in this flow can be predicted by a quasisteady theory
