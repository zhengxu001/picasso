713  static longitudinal stability characteristics of a blunted glider reentry configuration having 795degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at  a mach number of 62 and angles of attack up to 20degree   mayo, ee  nasa tm x222 1959   static longitudinal stability characteristics of a blunted glider reentry configuration having 795degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at  a mach number of 62 and angles of attack up to 20degree  an experimental investigation was conducted at a mach number of 62 to determine the static longitudinal stability characteristics of a model of a blunted glider reentry configuration having 795degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral  the freestream reynolds number for the investigation was 30 x 10 based on the basic model length of 75 inches  tests were made through an angleofattack range from 0degrees to investigation showed that incorporating 10degree nose incidence in the basic model resulted in a lower liftcurve slope, a lower liftdrag ratio, a higher value of trim lift coefficient, and a decrease in static  longitudinal stability  in comparison, the effect of extending the configuration length and incorporating 10degrees and 20degrees boattail angles resulted in smaller changes in the longitudinal stability characteristics of the model
