122  a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure around conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonic flow   willi f jacobs  lockheed aircraft corporation, georgia division  a simplified approximate method for the calculation of the pressure around conical bodies of arbitrary shape in supersonic and hypersonic flow  exact conicalflow solutions are available only for circular cones at zero angle of attack   for nonaxisymmetric cones or cones at angle of attack, only approximate methods exist   these methods are generally quite complicated and further limited to certain body shapes or certain machnumber ranges   a great need was therefore felt for a simple approximate method applicable to any arbitrarily shaped conical body at zero incidence as well as at angle of attack  such a method has been developed recently at lockheed and is presented here in abbreviated form   the method is based on the /equivalentcone/ theory   this theory determines the pressure on a conical body utilizing information for a symmetric cone at zero angle of attack with the same normal component of the free stream with respect to the surface as the local element of the body considered   this method works relatively well at high mach numbers   however, it is quite inconsistent at lower mach numbers, especially for bodies which deviate considerably from circular cones   the equivalentcone method does not give satisfactory results, mainly due to the fact that it considers only the local surface element on the body independent of the other body elements in the newtoniantheory manner
