1331  calculated responses of a large sweptwing airplane to continuous turbulence with flighttest comparisons   bennett,fv and pratt,kg  nasa tr r69, 1960  calculated responses of a large sweptwing airplane to continuous turbulence with flighttest comparisons    calculated responses of symmetrical airplane motions, wing deformations, and wing loads due to gusts are shown to compare favorably with available flighttest results   these calculated responses are based on randomprocess theory, five degrees of freedom, liftingsurface aerodynamics, and onedimensional vertical turbulence   the extent to which various degrees of freedom contribute to the responses is examined and in this connection the relative effects of static and dynamic aeroelasticity are determined
