63  hypersonic viscous flow over slender cones   talbot,l  naca tn4327, 1958  hypersonic viscous flow over slender cones    viscous selfinduced pressures on 3 semivertexangle cones were measured over the range 37 freestream mach number 58 and 05 viscousinteraction parameter 23   the data were found to be in good agreement with results obtained by talbot on 5 cones in the range rameter 35   all these data were correlated reasonably well by the viscousinteraction parameter, which is defined as where and are the mach number and reynolds number based on ideal taylormaccoll flow conditions and c is the chapmanrubesin factor    a new method for calculating selfinduced pressures is presented which takes into account the interaction between boundarylayer growth and the inviscidflow field at the outer edge of the boundary layer  pressures calculated by this method were only 10 to 20 percent higher than the measured values
