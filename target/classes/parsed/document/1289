1289  numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculation of unsteady aerodynamic forces due to continuous sinusoidal gusts on several wing planforms at sobsonic speeds   murrow,hn, pratt,kg and drischler,ja  nasa tnd1501, 1963  numerical technique to lifting surface theory for calculation of unsteady aerodynamic forces due to continuous sinusoidal gusts on several wing planforms at sobsonic speeds    a numerical liftingsurface method has been used to calculate direct gust forces and moments on wings of several planforms   the gust velocities are continuous and vary sinusoidally in the stream direction and are also uniform across the wing span   the procedure has the advantage of rapid machine calculation and includes the effects of wing planform, nonsteady subsonic flow, and induced flow effects   the method provides for calculation of gust forces on a basis consistent with that for the calculation of forces due to motion and deformation   the results include the inphase and quadrature components of the following quantities   (a) spanwise distribution of section lift coefficient, (b) total lift coefficient, and (c) total pitchingmoment coefficient   in addition, generalized gust forces on approximate fundamental cantilever bending modes ( parabolic) are also included   results have been obtained for 60 and 75 delta wings, ratio 1160, and an unswept wing of aspect ratio 600   conditions for which calculations were made include two mach numbers reducedfrequency range of 0 to 10   the direct gust forces and moments are in forms suitable to be inserted in equations of motion used in the calculation of the dynamic responses of flexible lifting vehicles to random turbulence and to be compared with results from other methods
