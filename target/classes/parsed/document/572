572  boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness effects in high temperature hypersonic flow   cheng, hk, hall,jg, golian, tc and hertzberg, a  j aero sc v 28, pp 353381, 410 1961   boundary layer displacement and leading edge bluntness effects in high temperature hypersonic flow  two important features of hypersonic flow over slender or thin bodies are the displacement effect of the boundary layer and the large downstream influence of leadingedge bluntness  the present paper contributes new theoretical and experimental results on this problem  the interaction of the two effects is treated theoretically by extending  the basic shocklayer concept  in the outer inviscid flow, a model consisting of a detached shock layer and an entropy layer is introduced to account for bluntness  in the boundary layer, the approximate solution is found to be governed by a local flatplate similarity  under the assumption of a strong bow shock and a specific heat ratio close to unity, a theory is developed for an arbitrary thin body  for flatplate  afterbodies, the theory yields a solution agreeing with blastwave theory at one limit and stronginteraction theory at the other  within the framework of the present theory, the problems involving angle of attack are also analyzed  complementary to the above study, a hypersonic similitude involving strong shocks, but not requiring close to one  a natural comparison with experimental data correlated on the basis of this similitude  flatplate experiments in air, conducted in the cal 11 x 15dashin hypersonic shock tunnel under coldwall conditions, included measurement  of surface heattransfer distributions and schlieren studies for zero and nonzero angle of attack  steady laminar heattransfer rates were measured by means of thinfilm resistance thermometers at air testflow mach numbers around 12, freestream reynolds numbers from 14 x 10 to 1 for most of the experiments, airflow stagnation temperatures ranged from ratios of about 015  the range of test conditions at this stagnation temperature encompassed the limiting cases of dominant bluntness and dominant viscousinteraction effects  heattransfer distributions were also measured on a sharp plate for air stagnation temperatures ranging from 2,000degreek up to 4,000degreek  the experimental data are quite well correlated in terms of the foregoing theoretical similitude variables characterizing combined effects of boundarylayer displacement and bluntness  the correlations obtained  suggest that for the present experimental conditions, at least, the hypersonic viscous similitude is valid even with leadingedge bluntness  in the paper, is generally fair
