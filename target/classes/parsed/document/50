50  investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressible fluids using the crocco method   van driest,er  naca tn2597, 1952  investigation of laminar boundary layer in compressible fluids using the crocco method    in the present investigation of the flow of air in a thin laminar boundary layer on a flat plate, the crocco method has been used to solve the simultaneous differential equations of momentum and energy involved in such flow   the crocco method was used because it gave accurate results for arbitrary prandtl number near unity   the prandtl number was taken at 075, the specific heat was held constant, and the sutherland law of viscositytemperature variation was assumed to represent the viscosity data starting with an initial ambient temperature of 676 f   the main results presented here are the skinfriction and heattransfer coefficients as functions of reynolds number, mach number, and walltofreestream temperature ratio   variations of shear, velocity, temperature, and mach number across the boundary layer are included   the crocco method is discussed in detail
