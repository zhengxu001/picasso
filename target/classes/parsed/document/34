34  constanttemperature magnetogasdynamic channel flow   kerrebrock,jp and marble,fe  j ae scs 27, 1960, 78  constanttemperature magnetogasdynamic channel flow  in the course of investigating boundarylayer flow in continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple closedform solutions for the magnetogasdynamic flow in the duct which could serve as freestream conditions for the boundary layers   nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained through numerical integration    consequently, some simple solutions of magnetogasdynamic channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity to serve as freestream boundary conditions for analytic investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator  in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to be an important physical problem because of the high gas temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity, channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting  some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs
