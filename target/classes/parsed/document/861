861  charts adapted from van driest turbulent flatplate theory for determining values of turbulent aerodynamic friction and heat transfer coefficients   lee,db and faget,ma  naca tn3811, 1956  charts adapted from van driest turbulent flatplate theory for determining values of turbulent aerodynamic friction and heat transfer coefficients    a modified method of van driest flatplate theory for turbulent boundary layer has been found to simplify the calculation of local skinfriction coefficients which, in turn, have made it possible to obtain through reynolds analogy theoretical turbulent heattransfer coefficients in the form of stanton number   a general formula is given and charts are presented from which the modified method can be solved for mach numbers 10 to 120, temperature ratios 02 to 60, and reynolds numbers 02 x 10 to 200 x 10
