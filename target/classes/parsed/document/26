26  inviscid leadingedge effect in hypersonic flow   cheng,hk and pallone,aj  j ae scs 23, 1956, 700  inviscid leadingedge effect in hypersonic flow  current interest in the problem of inviscidviscous interaction has led to the realization of the significant effect of the leadingedge thickness in hypersonic flow   the purpose of this note is to give an account of the downstream influence of the blunt leading edge on the basis of the hypersonic small perturbation theory
