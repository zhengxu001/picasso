987  a general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines of axialradialand mixedflow types   wu, c  naca tn 2604, 1952   a general theory of three dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines of axialradialand mixedflow types  a general theory of steady threedimensional flow of a nonviscous fluid in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines having arbitrary hub and casing  shapes and a finite number of blades is presented  the solution of the  threedimensional direct and inverse problem is obtained by investigating an appropriate combination of flows on relative stream surfaces whose intersections with a zplane either upstream of or somewhere inside the blade row form a circular arc or a radial line  the equations obtained to describe the fluid flow on these stream surfaces show clearly the several approximations involved in ordinary twodimensional treatments  they also lead to a solution of the threedimensional problem in a mathematically twodimensional manner through iteration  the equation of continuity is combined with the equation of motion in either the tangential or the radial direction through the use of a stream function defined on the surface, and the resulting equation is chosen as the principal equation for such flows  the character of this equation depends on the relative magnitude of the local velocity of sound and a certain combination of velocity components of the fluid  a general method to solve this equation by both hand and highspeed digital machine computations when the equation is elliptic or hyperbolic  is described  the theory is applicable to both irrotational and rotational absolute flow at the inlet of the blade row and at both design and offdesign operations
