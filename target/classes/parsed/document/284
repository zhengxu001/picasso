284  the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwise bending   biot,ma  j ae scs 23, 1956  the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwise bending    the static aeroelastic stability or divergence problem is investigated for thin supersonic wings when not only the spanwise bending and twist are taken into account but also the chordwise bending   the problem is treated in successive phases of increasing complexity from the twodimensional curlingup of the leading edge to the threedimensional stability of the cantilever wing   several methods of approach are developed including the nonlinear aspects of the structure and the aerodynamics  results indicate a strong dependence of stability on poisson ratio and the magnitude of the deformation
