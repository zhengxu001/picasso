948  panel flutter tests on full scale x15 lower vertical stabilizer at mach number of 3 0  bohon,hl  nasa tnd1385, 1962  panel flutter tests on full scale x15 lower vertical stabilizer at mach number of 3 0   panel flutter tests were conducted on two fullscale vertical stabilizers of the x15 airplane at a mach number of 30 in the langley at dynamic pressures from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and stagnation temperatures from 300 f to 660 f   flutter boundaries were obtained for four of the five distinct types of panels which make up the vertical sides of the stabilizers   the boundaries consisted of a flatpanel boundary and a thermally buckledpanel boundary   the flatpanel boundaries were characterized by a reduction in dynamic pressure with increasing skin temperature, whereas, after thermal buckling the trend was reversed   the minimum dynamic pressure for flutter occurred at the intersection of the flatpanel and buckledpanel boundaries and represented a large reduction in the dynamic pressure over the extrapolated, unstressed value  as a result of panel flutter, three of the five distinct types of panels were modified to provide the required flutter margin on the design flight dynamic pressure of the aircraft
