793  the flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 06  and 16   hall, im and rogers, ewe  arc r + m 3271, part 1, july 1960   the flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 06  and 16  the development of the flow pattern on a swept wing with incidence and stream mach number is described  the wing, of aspect ratio 2 828, taper ratio 0 333 and leadingedge sweep 53 5 deg, was tested at mach numbers between 0 6 and 1 6 at incidences up to about 12 deg  the test reynolds number varied with mach number, being typically 2 3 x 10 at m leading edge  it is shown that the flow pattern at moderate incidences develops smoothly from a subsonic type involving leadingedge separation to a supersonic type where the flow is attached near the leading edge and with shockinduced separation further aft  the formation and movement of the shockwave system and the vortices near the wing surface are briefly discussed
