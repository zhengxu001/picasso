1385  air flow in a separating laminar boundary layer   schubauer,gb  naca r527, 1935  air flow in a separating laminar boundary layer    the speed distribution in a laminar boundary layer on the surface of an elliptic cylinder, of major and minor axes 1178 and 398 inches, respectively, has been determined by means of a hotwire anemometer   the direction of the impinging air stream was parallel to the major axis  special attention was given to the speed distribution in the region of separation and to the exact location of the point of separation   an approximate method, developed by k pohlhausen for computing the speed distribution, the thickness of the layer, and the point of separation, is described in detail, and speeddistribution curves calculated by this method are presented for comparison with experiment   good agreement is obtained along the forward part of the cylinder, but pohlhausen method fails shortly before the separation point is reached and consequently cannot be used to locate this point    the work was carried out at the national bureau of standards with the cooperation and financial assistance of the national advisory committee for aeronautics
