1170  structural loads surveys on two tiltwing vtol configurations   ward,jf  nasa tnd729, 1961  structural loads surveys on two tiltwing vtol configurations    the results of two structuralloads surveys are summarized   the first loads program discussed concerns the airframe vibratory loads encountered during flight tests of the vz2 tiltwing vtol aircraft throughout the operational range from hover to cruise flight   the primary sources of airframe vibration were wingstall buffeting and tail buffeting in descents   the second loads program discussed concerns the initial results of a structuralloads survey conducted as part of the windtunnel test of a largescale tiltwing research model  this loads program deals with the steady wing loads measured throughout simulated transition from hover to cruise
