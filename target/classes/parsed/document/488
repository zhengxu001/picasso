488  a reactionrate parameter for gasdynamics of a chemically reacting gas mixture   leonard,m  jaescs 29, 1962, 995  a reactionrate parameter for gasdynamics of a chemically reacting gas mixture    presented note proposes a linearized reaction rate parameter which is applicable to any reacting gas mixture provided all the pertinent reactions and their rate constants are known at the thermodynamic conditions under consideration   linearizing is achieved by expanding equation of rate of chemical reaction in a taylor series and neglecting higherorder terms   author announces that tables of linearized reaction rate parameters for dissociated and slightly ionized air are now in preparation at the space sciences laboratory, general electric co, msvo    comparison of preliminary results with exact calculations published by hall, i g, etal, /inviscid hypersonic airflows with coupled nonequilibrium processes/ (ias paper 6267, 30th annual meeting, new york, jan 1962) indicates good agreement
