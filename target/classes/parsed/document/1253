1253  hypersonic viscous flow near the stagnation point in the presence of magnetic field   wu,chingsheng  j ae scs 1960, 882  hypersonic viscous flow near the stagnation point in the presence of magnetic field    the present study investigates the hypersonic viscous flow past bluntnosed bodies with hydromagnetic interaction  localsimilarity solutions of flow field and temperature distribution are near the stagnationpoint region   the discussions may be grouped into two parts   the twodimensional problem (circular cylinder) and axisymmetric problem (sphere)    numerical computations have been carried out for the sphere problem for the /viscouslayer regime,/ with various magnetic field strengths and electrical conductivities
