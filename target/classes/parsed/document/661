661  summary of laminar boundary layer solutions for wedgetype flow over convection and transpiration cooled surfaces   livingood,jnb and donoughe,p  naca tn3588, 1955  summary of laminar boundary layer solutions for wedgetype flow over convection and transpiration cooled surfaces    a summary of exact solutions of the laminarboundarylayer equations for wedgetype flow, useful in estimating heat transfer to such arbitrarily shaped bodies as turbine blades, is presented   the solutions are determined for small mach numbers and a prandtl number at the wall of 07 , ranges of mainstream pressure gradients and rates of coolant flow through a porous wall are considered for the following cases   (1) small temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constant and along a variabletemperature wall, and (2) large temperature changes in the boundary layer along a constanttemperature wall    dimensionless forms of heattransfer and friction parameters and boundarylayer thicknesses are tabulated  the results indicate that coolant emission and increased streamtowall temperature ratios diminished the friction and heat transfer for a constant wall temperature   for a variable wall temperature with small temperature differences in the boundary layer, the friction was unaffected, but the heat transfer was greatly increased for increased walltemperature gradient   heattransfer results in the literature reveal that transpiration cooling is much more effective for prandtl numbers of the order of 50 than for 07
