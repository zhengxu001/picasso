1336  studies of the use of freon12 as a wind tunnel testing medium   vondoenhoff  naca tn3000, 1953  studies of the use of freon12 as a wind tunnel testing medium    a number of studies relating to the use of freon12 as a substitute medium for air in aerodynamic testing have been made   the use of freon12 instead of air makes possible large savings in windtunnel drive power   because of the fact that the ratio of specific heats is approximately 113 for freon12 as compared with 14 for air, some differences exist between data obtained in freon12 and in air  methods for predicting aerodynamic characteristics of bodies in air from data obtained in freon12, however, have been developed from the concept of similarity of the streamline pattern   these methods, derived from consideration of twodimensional flows, provide substantial agreement in all cases for which comparative data are available   these data consist of measurements throughout a range of mach number from approximately 04 to 12 of pressure distributions and hinge moments on swept and unswept wings having aspect ratios ranging from 40 to 90, including cases where a substantial part of the wing was stalled    the freon charging and recovery system used for the langley lowturbulence pressure tunnel is described
