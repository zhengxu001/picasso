576  viscous and inviscid stagnation flow in a dissociated hypervelocity free  stream   inger, gr  proc 1962 heat transfer and fluid mech inst   viscous and inviscid stagnation flow in a dissociated hypervelocity free  stream  high reynolds number hypersonic stagnation flow over a bluntnosed body in a nonequilibrium dissociated free stream is analyzed and compared to a similar flow in an initially undissociated ambient gas  free stream dissociation effects on various equilibrium stagnation flow properties in air are presented as a function of the ambient atom mass fraction and  dissociation energy for velocities ranging from 15,000 to 25,000 fps  significant changes in the bow shock geometry, stagnation gas state, and  boundary layer behavior are found when the free stream dissociation involves more than 10( of the total energy  it is observed that for large amounts of both atomic oxygen and nitrogen ahead of the body, the equilibrium shock layer properties converge toward those pertaining to chemically and vibrationallyfrozen flow across the bow shock  moreover, under certain conditions, the ionization level can be increased by  an order of magnitude and the usual reduction in frozen boundary layer heat transfer due to a highlycooled noncatalytic surface can increase from stall of adjacent stages  the effects of compromises of stage matching to favor partspeed operation were also considered  this phase of the study indicated that such compromises would severely reduce the completecompressorstall margin  furthermore, the lowspeed stage stall problem is transferred from the inlet stages to the middle stages, which are more susceptible to abruptstall characteristics  the analysis indicates that inlet stages having continuous performance characteristics at their stall points are desirable with respect to partspeed compressor performance  these characteristics must, however,  be obtained when the stages are operating in the flow environment of the multistage compressor  alleviation of partspeed operational problems may also be obtained by improvement in either stage flow range or stage loading margin  the results of this analysis are only qualitative  the trends obtained,  however, are in agreement with those obtained from experimental studies  of highpressureratio multistage axialflow compressors, and the results are valuable in developing an understanding of the offdesign problem  in addition to these stagematching studies, a general discussion of variablegeometry features such as air bleed and adjustable  gas model  numerical solutions of nonequilibrium airflows with fully coupled chemistry provide a preliminary verification of such scaling for benser, wa  limit characteristics  the analysis indicated that all these problems could be attributed to discontinuities in the performance characteristics of the front stages  such discontinuities can be due to the type  of stage stall or to a deterioration of stage performance resulting blades is included
