500  joule heating in magnetohydrodynamic freeconvection flows   cramer,kr  jaescs, 29, 1962, 746  joule heating in magnetohydrodynamic freeconvection flows    the steady, fully developed, laminar, freeconvection flow of an electrically conducting fluid between two fully submerged openended, constanttemperature vertical plates located in a constant, uniformly distributed, transverse magnetic field has been analyzed with the joule heating term retained in the energy equation  analytic results are obtained   such analytic results are useful in estimating the actual magnitude of the influence of joule heating as well as a qualitative description of the manner in which it alters the temperature and flow fields   the present result confirms the usual practice that the influence of joule heating is negligibly small
