1016  principles of creep buckling weightstrength analysis     principles of creep buckling weightstrength analysis    the relation of the timedependent tangentmodulus loadas conceived by shanleyto actual column capacity is clarified   it may be interpreted as a limiting case of the conservative estimate   the timedependent tangentmodulus load is, therefore, an approximation to a conservative estimate   the approximation, however, may be either conservative or nonconservative when applied to imperfect or real columns   typical cases are discussed and experimental results for two alloys are cited
