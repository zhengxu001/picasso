812  investigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flight over a mach number range from 0 35 to 2 15   coltrane,lc  naca rm l58a16, 1958  investigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flight over a mach number range from 0 35 to 2 15    a finenessratio271 right circular cylinder and a fineness ratiobeen tested in free flight over a mach number range of 035 to 215 and a reynolds number range of 1 x 10 to 12 x 10   time histories, cross plots of force coefficients, rolling velocity, and longitudinalforce coefficient are presented for both cylinders   in addition, cross plots of moment coefficients and plots of the normalforce curve slope and the aerodynamic center are presented for the finenessratio271 cylinder   the average aerodynamic center of the right circular cylinder moved rearward with decreasing speeds until at the subsonic mach numbers it remained approximately constant and comparisons of the drag data of this test with wind tunnel and other freeflight data show good agreement   an appreciable decrease in drag was observed when the data of the present test of the rounded nose cylinder were compared with data of a right circular cylinder of a similar configuration
