996  extension of boundary layer separation criteria to a m=6 5 utilizing flat plates with forwardfacing steps   sterrett,jr and emery,jc  nasa tnd618, 1960  extension of boundary layer separation criteria to a m=6 5 utilizing flat plates with forwardfacing steps    an experimental investigation has been made of the separation phenomena on a flat plate to which forwardfacing steps were attached to force separation   both laminar and turbulent flows were investigated over a mach number range of approximately distributions, shadowgraph and chemical film techniques, the pressure rise at separation, the laminar plateau pressure, and the turbulent peak pressure were determined  boundarylayer surveys were made on a smooth flat plate and on a flat plate with roughness to force transition   examinations of the separated flow showed that the predominant variable in the determination of the pressure distribution was the location of transition relative to the separation point and reattachment  pure laminar, transitional, and turbulent types of separation were found in this mach number range   the peak staticpressurerise ratios for identical forwardfacing steps at a mach number of 625 were approximately 15 and 50, respectively, for pure laminar and turbulent separation   the effect of reynolds number on the peak pressure rise for turbulent separation for the lower mach number range was found to be very minor provided the step height was of the order of the boundarylayer thickness   as the mach number is increased, the peak pressure coefficient for turbulent separation decreased from approximately 018 at a mach number of 4 to about 013 at a mach number of 625   the pressure coefficient at the separation point for laminar separation decreases from approximately 0014 at a mach number of value at a mach number of 65   the results obtained with forwardfacing steps agree with the trends predicted, based upon lower mach number studies
