959  heat transfer in separated flows   larson,hk  j ae scs 1959, 731  heat transfer in separated flows    results of an experimental heattransfer investigation in regions of separated flow are presented and compared with the theoretical analysis of naca tn 3792   the average heat transfer for both laminar and turbulent separated boundary layers was found to be from 35 to 50 per cent less than that for equivalent attached boundary layers   the overall scope of the measurements included mach numbers from 03 to 40 and reynolds numbers from 10 to 4 x 10   the results for laminar boundary layers agree well with the analysis of tn 3792   the results for turbulent boundary layers, however, disagree considerably   results of velocity and temperature surveys in the separated turbulent boundary layer are presented and partially explain the discrepancy between the experiments and analysis  the maximum local heattransfer rates were found to occur in the reattachment region of the separated boundary layers investigated   the effect of transition on heat transfer in the separated laminar boundary layers is described and data showing effects of mach number and wall temperature on the transition reynolds number of separated laminar flows are also included
