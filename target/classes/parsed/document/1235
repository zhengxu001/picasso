1235  a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer over a curved surface   yen,kt and toba,k  j ae scs 1961, 877  a theory of the two dimensional laminar bounary layer over a curved surface    the purpose of this paper is to present a theory to account for surface curvature effects on the twodimensional boundarylayer flow which approaches a potential flow at free stream    the problem of twodimensional viscous flow is first formulated by using the streamlines and their orthogonal trajectories as the generalized coordinates   a boundarylayer approximation is applied to the navierstokes equations and the gauss equation in the generalized coordinates to yield the boundarylayer equations   the conditions under which similar solutions of the boundarylayer equations exist are determined   by a simple transformation, the governing differential equation can be expressed in a form which reduces to the falknerskan equation for zero surface curvature    numerical results for a similar solution which corresponds to a flow over a curved surface with zero surface pressure gradient have been obtained   the velocity profiles in the boundary layer and the wall skinfriction distribution for concave and convex surfaces are presented   the wall skin friction for a convex wall is found to be higher than the blasius value for a flat plate   on the other hand, for a concave wall, the skin friction will drop below the blasius value as the curvature increases, but it appears to reach a minimum, and beyond this minimum point it will increase again   the same flow problem was treated by murphy by a different method of analysis   comparison of murphy results with those obtained by the present method reveals some basic differences in the boundarylayer characteristics   in particular, murphy results indicate that the wall skin friction for a convex surface is smaller than the blasius value, while for a concave wall it is higher
