54  method for calculation of compressible laminar boundary layer characteristics in axial pressure gradient with zero heat transfer   morduchow,m and clarke,jh  naca tn2784, 1952  method for calculation of compressible laminar boundary layer characteristics in axial pressure gradient with zero heat transfer    the karmanpohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixthdegree velocity profiles for determining the characteristics of the compressible laminar boundary layer over an adiabatic wall in the presence of an axial pressure gradient   it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity and that the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature  a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination of the boundarylayer characteristics for any given freestream mach number and given velocity distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layer is obtained   numerical examples indicate that this solution will in practice lead to results of satisfactory accuracy, including the critical reynolds number for stability   for the special purpose of calculating the location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, a short and simple method, based on the use of a seventhdegree velocity profile, is derived   the numerical example given here indicates that this method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results  for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shown that the karmanpohlhausen method with the usual fourthdegree profiles leads to results of adequate accuracy, even for the critical reynolds number
