763  effects of internal pressure on the buckling of circularcylindrical shells under bending  weingarten,vi   effects of internal pressure on the buckling of circularcylindrical shells under bending   the effect of internal pressure on the smalldeflection buckling of thinwalled cylinders under bending is investigated by means of a modified donnell equation   the results indicate that the maximum critical stress due to bending increases with internal pressure, unlike the case of pressurized cylinders under compression   these results represent the moment at which significant deformations appear in the cylinder, rather than the maximum moment able to be carried, but may be a good approximation to the latter for metal cylinders
