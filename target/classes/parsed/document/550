550  laminar heat transfer in tubes under slipflow conditions   sparrow,em and lin,sh  asme paper 61wa165  laminar heat transfer in tubes under slipflow conditions  the effects of lowdensity phenomena on the fully developed heattransfer characteristics for laminar flow in tubes has been studied analytically   consideration is given to the slipflow regime wherein the major rarefaction effects are manifested as velocity and temperature jumps at the tube wall   the analysis is carried out for both uniform wall temperature and uniform wall heat flux  in both cases, the slipflow nusselt numbers are lower than those for continuum flow and decrease with increasing mean free path  extension of the results is made to include the effects of shear work at the wall, temperature jump modifications for a moving fluid, and thermal creep
