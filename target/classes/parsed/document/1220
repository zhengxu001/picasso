1220  boundary layer transition in the presence of streamwise vortices   tani,i and komoda,h  j ae scs1962, 440  boundary layer transition in the presence of streamwise vortices    results of an experimental investigation of instability leading to transition in the subsonic boundary layer flow along a flat plate are presented   a series of wings was placed outside the boundary layer to produce streamwise vortices, which in turn made the boundary layer threedimensionalie, periodic in thickness in the spanwise direction   hotwire measurements were made to trace the downstream development of the disturbance or wave created by the vibrating ribbon   as the wave travels downstream, it is deformed into a threedimensional configuration by the threedimensionality of the boundarylayer flow, but it is eventually damped out so long as it remains small in intensity   it is only after the wave intensity exceeds a certain amount (which depends on the degree of boundarylayer threedimensionality) that the nonlinear effect manifests itself by the rapid amplification of wave intensity, the rapid increase in wave threedimensionality, and the distortion in mean velocity profile  the appearance of nonlinear development inevitably leads to the breakdown of laminar flow, and hence the onset of turbulence  there is present a mechanism by which the energy is transferred from one spanwise position to another so that the breakdown of laminar flow occurs as a consequence of threedimensional development of the wave as a whole
