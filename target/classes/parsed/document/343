343  transpiration cooling experiments in a turbulent boundary layer at m=3   leadon,bm and scott,cj  j ae scs 23, 1956  transpiration cooling experiments in a turbulent boundary layer at m=3    turbulent recovery factor and heattransfer measurements have been made on a porous flat wall section at a nominal mach number of 30 and a reynolds number of approximately 4 x 10 using both air and helium as the transpired gas   measured heattransfer coefficients correlate well with the compressible theory of rubesin for air and qualitatively with simple film theory for either coolant, indicating that the heat transfer from a turbulent boundary layer can be reduced by transpiration cooling to well below that of the uncooled boundary layer at the same reynolds number
