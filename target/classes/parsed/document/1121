1121  compressive and torsional buckling of thinwall cylinders in the yield region   gerard,g  naca tn3726, 1956  compressive and torsional buckling of thinwall cylinders in the yield region    based on assumptions which have led to the best agreement between theory and test data on inelastic buckling of flat plates, a general set of equilibrium differential equations for the plastic buckling of cylinders has been derived   these equations have been used to obtain solutions for the compressive and torsional buckling of long cylinders in the yield region    test data are presented which indicate satisfactory agreement with the theoretical plasticityreduction factors in most cases   where a difference in results exists, test data are in substantially better agreement with the results obtained by use of the maximumshear law rather than the octahedralshear law to transform axial stressstrain data to shear stressstrain data
