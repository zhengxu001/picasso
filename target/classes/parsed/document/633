633  an extension of the method of generalised conical flows for lifting wings in supersonic flow   portnoy,h  rae tn aero2849, 1962  an extension of the method of generalised conical flows for lifting wings in supersonic flow    the method of generalised conical flows has previously been developed subject to the condition that the upwash divided by the streamwise coordinate to the power k, where k is the order of the conical flow, must have vanishing (k+1)th derivative with respect to the conical coordinate    in the present note this restriction is removed    the results are also used to discuss the effect of the application of the leading edge attachment condition on the wing pressure and geometry
