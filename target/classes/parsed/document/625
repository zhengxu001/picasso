625  viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flows   whalen,rj  j ae scs 29, 1962, 1222  viscous and inviscid nonequilibrium gas flows    the condition of immediate freezing of the mass fraction of dissociated species of air at the equilibrium value behind the shock envelope prevails over a major portion of the flight spectrum associated with lifting reentry vehicles   this is observed by means of orderofmagnitude considerations within the limits of the present knowledge of chemical reaction rates for the constituents of air   accordingly, investigations of the viscous and inviscid hypersonic flow about blunt and sharp leading edge slender bodies are made   the investigations are generalized to consider an arbitrary degree of dissociation in the ambient free stream   this condition is included in order to allow comparison with the flow field about a model in the test section of a hypersonic facility with dissociated air species present in the free stream    inviscid frozen flow investigations are made for blunt and sharp leading edge slender body powerlaw geometries   the results indicate that the influence of a finite leading edge, in inducing a pressure field far downstream (/blastwave/ analogy), is considerably diminished for this model   this conclusion is verified numerically by a characteristics solution for the hypersonic flow about a /sonicwedge/ slab    the viscous investigations consider the boundarylayer interaction problem with a frozen degree of dissociation   in this case, as in the inviscid analysis, the governing parameter is observed to be the ratio of the dissociation energy to the freestream kinetic energy   the influence of this parameter on the boundarylayer interaction mechanism for a highly cooled, noncatalytic wall is presented  the influence of a frozen flow field on skin friction and heat transfer is also discussed    finally, since higher mach number gas flows may be generated in wind tunnel nozzles where dissociation nonequilibrium effects are present, the possibility of employing expansions with a controlled degree of dissociation as a technique for aerodynamic simulation is presented
