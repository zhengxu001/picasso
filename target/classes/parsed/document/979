979  correlation of base pressure and wake structure of sharp and bluntnose cones with reynolds number based on boundary layer momentum thickness   lehnert,r and schermerhorn,vl  j ae scs 26, 1959  correlation of base pressure and wake structure of sharp and bluntnose cones with reynolds number based on boundary layer momentum thickness  it has been established in the past that there is a certain relationship between base pressure and boundarylayer behavior   the basepressure and wakeflow conditions were found to be dependent upon the local flow characteristics at the surface of supersonic vehicles directly upstream of the base or of the region of wakeflow separation    in order to use existing data on cones and other shapes to predict wake angle and base pressure on blunt bodies, an attempt was made recently at the naval ordnance laboratory to establish a unique relationship between given local flow conditions at the downstream end of sharp and blunt cones at supersonic speeds and the corresponding wakeflow conditions with zero heat transfer
