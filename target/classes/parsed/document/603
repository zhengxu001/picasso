603  the 7 in x 7 in hypersonic wind tunnel at rae farnborough part ii heater performance   j f w crane   the 7 in x 7 in hypersonic wind tunnel at rae farnborough part ii heater performance  tests on the storage heater, which is cylindrical in form and mounted horizontally, show that its performance is adequate for operation at m=68 and probably adequate for flows at m=82 with the existing nozzles   in its present state, the maximum design temperature of 680 degrees centigrade for operation at m=9 cannot be realised in the tunnel because of heat loss to the outlet attachments of the heater and quickacting valve which form, in effect, a large heat sink   because of this heat loss there is rather poor response of stagnation temperature in the working section at the start of a run   it is hoped to cure this by preheating the heater outlet cone and the quickacting valve  at pressures greater than about 100 psig free convection through the fibrous thermal insulation surrounding the heated core causes the top of the heater shell to become somewhat hotter than the bottom, which results in /hogging/ distortion of the shell   this free convection cools the heater core and a vertical temperature gradient is set up across it after only a few minutes at high pressure  modifications to be incorporated in the heater to improve its performance are described
