200  calculation of derivatives for a cropped delta wing with subsonic leading edges oscillating in a supersonic airstream   watson,j  arc r + m 3060, 1958  calculation of derivatives for a cropped delta wing with subsonic leading edges oscillating in a supersonic airstream    the lift, pitching moment and fullspan constantchord control hingemoment are derived for a cropped delta wing describing harmonic plunging and pitching oscillations of small amplitude and lowfrequency parameter in a supersonic air stream   it is assumed that (a) the wing has subsonic leading edges, (b) the wing is sufficiently thin and the mach number sufficiently supersonic to permit the use of linearised theory    expressions for the various derivative coefficients are obtained for a particular delta wing of aspect ratio 18 and taper ratio these are avaluated and tabulated for mach numbers 11, 115, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 1944
