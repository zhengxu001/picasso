687  oscillating airfoils at high mach number   lighthill, mj  j aero sc v 20 june 1953 pp 402406   oscillating airfoils at high mach number  a simple formula is given for the pressure distribution on an oscillating airfoil in twodimensional flow at high mach number  the formula is expected to be reasonably accurate if the pressure on the surface remains within the range 02 to 35 times the mainstream pressure  to illustrate the application of the formula, some results for symmetrical airfoils performing pitching oscillations are obtained and compared with results obtained from existing theories in the case of  high mach number
