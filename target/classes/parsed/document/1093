1093  induced interference effects on jet and buriedfan vtol configurations in transition   spreemann,k+  nasa tnd731, 1961  induced interference effects on jet and buriedfan vtol configurations in transition    recent investigations of some jet and buriedfan configurations have indicated that in the transition speed range, configurations with considerable area surrounding the jet or buried fan can encounter large losses in lift and noseup pitching moments due to the pressures induced on the lower surfaces by the interaction of the jet and freestream flow   the obvious way of minimizing these effects is to reduce the surface area surrounding the jets or buried fans, that is, to consider these effects in the preliminary stages of the airplane design
