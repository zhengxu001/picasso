1227  pressuregradient effects on the preston tube in supersonic flow   naleid,jf and thompson,mj  j ae scs 1961, 940  pressuregradient effects on the preston tube in supersonic flow    this paper is concerned with an experimental investigation of the effects of a longitudinal pressure gradient in a supersonic stream of air over a bounding surface on the performance of a preston or impactpressure tube at the surface   evidence is presented which indicates that for the mach number considered and for the range of pressure gradients covered, the preston tube functions in a completely satisfactory manner for the determination of local shear stress
