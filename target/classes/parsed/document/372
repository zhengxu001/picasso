372  an experimental investigation of flow about simple blunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 5 8  oliver,re  j ae scs23, 1956, 177  an experimental investigation of flow about simple blunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 5 8   an experimental investigation was conducted in the galcit hypersonic wind tunnel to determine flow characteristics for a series of blunt bodies at a nominal mach number of 58 and freestream reynolds numbers per in of measured values for the pressure coefficient distributions are compared with a modified newtonian expression   the agreement is very good for the threedimensional bodies and is fair for the circular cylinder transverse to the freestream flow direction   a complete report of the investigation is given in a galcit hypersonic wind tunnel memorandum
