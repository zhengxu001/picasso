1214  the drag of elongated bodies over a wide reynolds number range   robertson,jm and clark,me  j ae scs 1962, 842  the drag of elongated bodies over a wide reynolds number range    the resistance of bodies in motion through an incompressible viscous fluid is predictable from stokes or oseentype solutions in the creepingmotion range, while some test information is available in the boundarylayer range   with the exception of experimental results for spheres or circular cylinders and analytical and experimental results for flat plates, almost no information is available on other bodies, particularly in the intermediate range of reynolds numbers extending from unity to a million    experimental results as obtained from hydroballistic studies in water and glycerinwater solutions are presented for finned ellipsoids of finenessratio 4 over a 20,000fold range and are correlated with available information on other bodies   although results do not extend down to the creepingmotion region where analytical predictions are available, comparison with the drag coefficient trends for spheres and flat plates indicates that an appropriate curve for the ellipsoid could be extended so as to cover the entire laminarviscous range   less extensive results are presented on the drag of finenessratio 8 ellipsoids and on laminarturbulent transition occurrences
