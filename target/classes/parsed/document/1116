1116  general instability of stiffened cylinders   becker,h  naca tn4237, 1958  general instability of stiffened cylinders    theoretical buckling stresses are determined in explicit form for circular cylinders with circumferential and axial stiffening   the loadings are axial compression, radial pressure, hydrostatic pressure, and torsion   analyses were confined to moderatelength and long cylinders   the investigation was based upon the use of a form of donnell equation derived by taylor which is applicable to orthotropic cylinders  the derivation of this equation is presented in this report
