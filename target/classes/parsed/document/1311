1311  some simple solutions to the problem of predicting boundary layer selfinduced pressures   bertram,mh and blackstock,ta  nasa tnd798, 1961  some simple solutions to the problem of predicting boundary layer selfinduced pressures    simplified theoretical approaches are shown, based on hypersonic similarity boundarylayer theory, which allow reasonably accurate estimates to be made of the surface pressures on plates on which viscous effects are important   the consideration of viscous effects includes the cases where curved surfaces, stream pressure gradients, and leadingedge bluntness are important factors
