1286  equilibrium realgas performance charts for a shypersonic shocktube windtunnel employing nitrogen   bernstein,l  arc cp633, 1961  equilibrium realgas performance charts for a shypersonic shocktube windtunnel employing nitrogen    charts are presented covering a wide range of reflectedshock windtunnel operating conditions, using nitrogen as the working gas   a statisticalmechanical model of the gas is assumed which takes account of molecular vibration, electronic excitation and dissociation   the gas is assumed to be constantly in equilibrium that is, the reaction rates are taken to be infinitely fast   the equations of motion are solved with the aid of a digital computer, previously reported results for the state of the shockprocessed gas in the shocktube being used
