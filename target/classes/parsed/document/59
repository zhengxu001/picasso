59  tables of exact laminarboundary layer solutions when the wall is porous and fluid properties are variable   brown,wd and donoughe,pl  naca tn2479, 1951  tables of exact laminarboundary layer solutions when the wall is porous and fluid properties are variable    the three partial differential equations of the laminar boundary layer for twodimensional steadystate compressible flow have been transformed into two ordinary differential equations by the method of pohlhausen, falkner, and skan   the ordinary equations include parameters for expressing the simultaneous effects of pressure gradient in the mainstream flow through a porous wall and property changes in the fluid due to large temperature differences between the wall and the free stream    a total of 58 cases have been solved numerically by the method of picard   the euler number (nondimensional pressuregradient parameter) ranges in value from 1 (stagnationpoint value) to the negative values found at the laminar separation points   three rates of flow through the porous wall were considered (including the impermeable case where the flow rate is 0)   five temperature ratios (stream temperature divided by wall temperature) were used   the uncooled and unheated case (temperature ratio of 1), two cooled cases (temperature ratios of ture ratios of and )   velocity, weightflow, and temperature distributions are tabulated as are the dimensionless stream function of falkner and skan and its derivatives and the dimensionless temperature function of pohlhausen and its derivatives    for each case, displacement, momentum, and convection thicknesses, as well as nusselt number and coefficient of friction at the wall, were computed
