1075  an experimental and theoretical investigation of secondorder supersonic  wingbody interference, for a nonlifting body with wings at incidence   wilby, pg  aero res inst of sweden, ffa report 87, 1960   an experimental and theoretical investigation of secondorder supersonic  wingbody interference, for a nonlifting body with wings at incidence  pressure distributions on the wing of two wingbody combinations are measured experimentally at mach numbers 3 and 4 with the wing at various  incidences in the range 0degree to 10degree  the results are compared with theoretical results which include interference effects calculated according to the secondorder supersonic wingbody interference theory due to landahl and beane /1/  this theory, having been tested previously for nonlifting wingbody combinations, is thus tested also for wings at incidence  the agreement between theory and experiment is found to vary with mach number and wing sweepback  for the higher mach number and moderate sweepback the theory gives a good prediction of pressure distribution, but for the most adverse condition of low mach number and large sweepback the theory is found to overestimate the interference effects  this is expected as the theory assumes the sweepback of the wings is small compared with that of the mach line  an  empirical guide to the limit of application of the interference theory is given  within this limit the agreement between theory and experiment  is found to deteriorate only a little with increase of incidence, over the range tested
