671  pressure and boundarylayer measurements on a two dimensional wing at low speed   brebner, gg and bagley, ja  arc r + m 2886, july, 1962   pressure and boundarylayer measurements on a two dimensional wing at low speed  results are given of pressure measurements and boundarylayer traverses on a twodimensional wing with 10 per cent rae 101 section at reynolds numbers of 16x10 and 32x10  these results which have been integrated to give lift, drag and aerodynamiccentre characteristics, are used to check some calculation methods for the growth of the turbulent boundary layer and for the effect of a known boundary layer on the pressure distribution  it is concluded that the calculation of the boundary layer still needs a little refinement before it is accurate enough to predict viscosity effects on pressure distribution, lift, drag and aerodynamic center,but  that these effects can be calculated if the actual boundarylayer characteristics are known
