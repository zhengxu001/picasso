409  on the base pressure resulting from the interaction of a supersonic external stream with a sonic or subsonic jet   chow, w l  j aero sc march, 1959  p 176180   on the base pressure resulting from the interaction of a supersonic external stream with a sonic or subsonic jet  it is shown that the twodimensional base pressure problems relating to base bleed into the wake of blunttrailingedge airfoils, or the interaction between an external supersonic or sonic slipstream with a sonic or subsonic jet stream of a jet engine, can be calculated by theoretical considerations  constantpressure, isoenergetic, turbulent mixing between the streams and the stagnant fluid in the wake is assumed  the theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results
