947  static aerodynamic characteristics of a short blunt 10 semivertex angle cone at a mach number of 15 in helium   fohrman,mj  nasa tnd1648, 1963  static aerodynamic characteristics of a short blunt 10 semivertex angle cone at a mach number of 15 in helium    axial force, normal force, pitching moment, and shockwave shape were determined for a body of revolution consisting of a short blunt 10 semivertex angle cone with a flat base and also with a conical afterbody having a semivertex angle of 50   measurements were made in helium at a freestream mach number of 15 and a freestream reynolds number of 225x10 based on maximum body diameter over an angleofattack range from   the configuration with the conical afterbody was statically stable in the noseforward attitude only, whereas the configuration with no afterbody was statically stable in both the noseforward and baseforward attitudes   the force and moment data of both shapes were predicted reasonably well by modified newtonian theory at all angles of attack, except the pitchingmoment coefficient for the model without afterbody near 180 angle of attack   in this region, measurements indicated static stability, whereas theory indicated static instability  the helium data agreed reasonably well with a limited amount of force and moment data obtained in a ballistic range at small angles of attack in air at a mach number of 15 and also with force and moment data obtained in air over a complete angleofattack range at a mach number of 55  the value of axialforce coefficient and the shape of the bow shock wave at zero angle of attack for both models obtained from a numerical flow field calculation agreed very well with the data  the value of the axial force coefficient at 180 angle of attack for the model with afterbody agreed reasonably well with the theoretical value for a cone   the position and shape of the shock envelope near the stagnation point also could be predicted accurately by an approximate method over an angleofattack range from
