589  some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressors     some stall and surge phenomena in axial flow compressors  observations of rotating stall have shown that a wide variety of stall patterns is possible       hotwire anemometer data on a multistage compressor have shown a progressivetype stall at low speeds  the amplitude of the flow fluctuations increases in magnitude through the first few stages and then diminishes rapidly to a small value in the latter stages  a stagestacking analysis has shown that rotating stall will exist over a large portion of the compressor map at low speeds but will be instigated almost simultaneously with compressor surge at high speeds       blades failures attributable to resonant vibrations excited by rotating stall have been experienced in single  and multistage compressors        in the stagestacking analysis no deterioration of stage performance due to unsteady flow resulting from stall of adjacent stages was considered  in general, the pressure drop at the stall point is believed to be much larger than indicated by an analytical formulation of compressor performance  compressor surge is attributed to a limit cycle operation about the compressor stall point, and, as indicated in a few compressor tests and in jetengine tests, a small compressor discharge receiver volume may result simply in stall of the compressor without the cyclic characteristics of compressor surge  in this event, engine operation will be limited because of the large drop in performance which accompanies compressor stall
