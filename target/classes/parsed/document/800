800  wall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder model   rogers, ewe and hall, im  arc, cp 510, september 1959   wall interference at transonic speeds on a hemisphere cylinder model  tests have been made in three npl wind tunnels on a pressureplotting  model consisting of a long cylinder with a hemispherical nose  the surface pressure distributions were measured for stream mach numbers between 07 and 11 at zero model incidence, and schlieren photographs were taken  the blockage ratios were 0211(, 0117( and 0120(  the principal feature of the flow is the effect of working section size on the rate at which the terminal shock wave moves back along the model with increasing stream mach number  this is thought to depend mainly on the distance from the model to the slotted walls of the tunnel, and not necessarily on the blockage ratio  the distance of the solid sidewall is important in influencing the local mach number ahead of the terminal shock, by reflecting the expansionwave system originating near  the model nose
