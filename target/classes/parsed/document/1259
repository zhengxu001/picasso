1259  secondorder theory for unsteady supersonic flow past slender pointed bodies of revolution   revell,jd  j ae scs1960, 730  secondorder theory for unsteady supersonic flow past slender pointed bodies of revolution    an analysis is made of the secondorder effects of thickness on the unsteady aerodynamic forces on a slender pointed body of revolution in supersonic flow   the theory is restricted to harmonic oscillations for small angles of attack   the solution is obtained by approximating the nonlinear terms in the secondorder potential equation by their firstorder values and solving the resulting inhomogeneous partial differential equation, subject to more refined boundary conditions   the pressure equation is likewise refined and integrated to give the secondorder corrections to lift and pitching moment coefficients   the analysis can be considered as an extension of the secondorder, slender body theory of lighthill to the case of unsteady flow    the results indicate appreciable reductions in unsteady lift and damping moment coefficients when applied to slender cones  the present theory is estimated to be reliable provided that is less than 07
