1064  propeller slipstream effects as determined from wing pressure distribution on a largescale sixpropeller vtol model at static thrust   winston,mm  nasa tnd1509, 1962  propeller slipstream effects as determined from wing pressure distribution on a largescale sixpropeller vtol model at static thrust    during staticthrust tests of a largescale general research model having a tilting wing and doubleslotted flaps, staticpressure measurements were made on a wing segment behind one propeller to survey the effects of the slipstream   for the conditions of highest slipstream energy, the hovering end point of aerodynamic parameters for aircraft having vertical and short takeoff and landing capability the tiltwing configuration (zero flap deflection) was a 6 spanwise variation in effective angle of attack in a span of slightly less than 1 propeller diameter  effective changes in camber on the tiltwing configuration as a result of slipstream rotation, the radial velocity gradient, and the resultant spanwise flow were negative and had a maximum magnitude of less than 2percent chord   for the deflectedslipstream configuration (doubleslotted flaps deflected), effects important to the hovering performance were found, including a 40percent spanwise variation in effective thrust recovery and a 20 spanwise variation in effective thrust turning
