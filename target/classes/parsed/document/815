815  investigation of several blunt bodies to determine trans onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects of spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and some measurements of unsteady base pressures   fisher,lr and dicamillo,jr  nasa memo 12159l, 1959  investigation of several blunt bodies to determine trans onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects of spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and some measurements of unsteady base pressures    several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for atmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34   the tests were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds numbers from 174 x 10 to 278 x 10, based on body diameter    a fullskirted rather than a shortskirted type of shape developed the greatest amount of static stability and the largest liftcurve slopes   the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears to be subject to mach number effects   spinning a fullskirted body about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static stability parameter through the transonic mach number range   the extension of segmented clamshellshaped flaps from the afterbody of a shortskirted model served to increase the lift and static stability only if the flaps extended into the airstream    some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two dissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach number in these tests   there is doubt, however, that these pressures can induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehicle because of their small amplitude and phasing
