freeman method the freeman method (ref26) is similar to chester method in that the newtonian plus centrifugal solution (eqwith the von mises transformation a method of successive approximations is applied to both plane and axially symmetric blunt nosed bodies for small and infinite free stream mach number formulas for the streamlines, shock shape, and pressure distribution are determined to this approximation a number of special shapes are treated in ref26, and in certain cases the theory has a singular point where the first approximation to the pressure vanishes., that is, for a sphere (see eq7 113) as in chester method, the theory is not applicable where the pressure becomes too small
