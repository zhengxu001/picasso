asymptotic solutions of toroidal shell problems  method of asymptotic integration developed by ereissner and author is refined, and solutions previously obtained for problems of bending of curved tube and of a toroidal expansion joint subject to an axial force are generalized and extended results are compared to those obtained by lbeskin for large values of a certain parameter, agreement is good
