an improvement on donnell approximation for thin walled circular cylinders  donnell equation for thin walled circular cylinders is replaced by where w is a non dimensional form of the radial displacement and q is the distributed radial loading this equation retains the essential simplicity of the original but, unlike donnell equation, the accuracy does not decrease as the wavelength of circumferential distortion increases
