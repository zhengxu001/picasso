knudsen flow through a circular capillary the problem of knudsen flow through a circular capillary has been often discussed, usually by the momentum transfer method however, pclausing gave a rigorous formulation for the problem and obtained an integral equation for which he gave an approximate solution from time to time the accuracy of clausing solution has been questioned and since clausing did not give a rigorous estimate of his error we have reinvestigated the problem
